title = "Not Built in a Day: Writing About Architecture"
+++

In 2008, I started a blog about my study abroad trip to Rome, which then turned into a more general blog on architecture, urban design, and the built environment generally.  I still write travel descriptions, but also book, movie, and exhibition reviews, occasional attempts at humor, and discussions of my own work.

All photographs are my own, unless indicated otherwise.
