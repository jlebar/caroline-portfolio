In 2009, I started a blog about my undergraduate study abroad trip to Rome, which grew into a blog on architecture, urban design, and the built environment.  Now in its tenth year, I continue to write travel descriptions, but also book, movie, and exhibition reviews, occasional attempts at humor, and discussions of my research and work as an architect.

Ever since I was introduced to the dense, multi-layered urbanism of Rome, I have been interested in how we build environments that support people and protect the environment.  The increasing urbanization of the world has provided us with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to turn away from the wasteful models of suburban development pursued in the west in recent decades, and to turn toward a more dense, livable, sustainable, and resilient future.  I hope my writing can shed light on, and argue for, this possible future.
