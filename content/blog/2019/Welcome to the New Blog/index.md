Welcome to the new and improved "Not Built in a Day!"  For the first time, I now have all my work in one place, including my design portfolio and my blog on architecture and design.  After ten years on Blogger, it was time for an update; while the new platform has fewer features (no more comments, no more search bar, etc) it's given me more control, and ensures that if Blogger gets killed off, as Google often does to their products without warning, my site will remain functional.  The comment feature was rarely used anyway.  All of the nearly 200 previous posts are still here, and hopefully there will be many more to come!  Copious thanks to Justin for making this happen.

So what else have I been up to since coming to Virginia this fall?

* **Teaching:** I have been teaching in the [Hampton University Department of Architecture](http://architecture.set.hamptonu.edu/), as an adjunct assistant professor, for the fourth year studio.  Hampton has a five-year master's (M. Arch) program, so this is year four of five.  I have been enjoying myself immensely, and am very grateful to the faculty at Bemis, and all the students, for welcoming me and allowing me to join their department.  The student projects this semester included an off-the-grid solar-powered car charging station; a high school for the study of sea level rise; and a museum on slavery, to be sited in Richmond.  I also had the privilege of working on the Fellowship (FAIA) application for the department chair, Mr. Robert Easter.  
* **Traveling:**  I was able to (or will shortly) visit New York, Durham, Richmond, Washington, DC, Atlanta, Monticello, Williamsburg, and Norfolk/Virginia Beach during my time here.  I have greatly enjoyed the chance to see old friends, witness the changes to places I used to live, and learn more about Virginia during my time here.  
* **Reading:** With my newfound free time, I've been catching up on industry publications, books about public interest design and community design, and even some reading for fun - especially young adult fiction.  
* **Researching:** As the semester comes to a close, my next focus will be on finding firms in San Francisco that I will want to work with.  My main criteria will be area of specialty (housing, public projects), sustainable design (2030 Challenge signatories), and quality of the firm culture.  If you love your firm in SF and think I should consider them, please reach out!  
* **New projects:** Aside from this website, my recent personal projects have included updating my portfolio (now six years out of date) and working on a couple of art pieces using stickers from my childhood.  I'm still in the process of laying to rest old projects that I started years ago, so I can begin 2020 with a clean slate and the ability to take on new things!

I'm excited about 2020 and looking forward to a new adventure in San Francisco.
