(Note: I started this post in November - and apparently didn't finish it, then forgot about it.  It's now the middle of the following semester, but I thought I'd go ahead and post it anyway!)

Hello all,

I will soon stop apologizing for not posting regularly, because I realize that I will never be a regular post-er.  So without further ado, here are some of the things I've been working on here in my first semester of architecture school.

We begin, of course, with food!  Now that I'm in grad school, my primary recreational activity is cooking for myself.  Not that I have much time - I probably only cook once or twice a week.  When I do, this is what I like to make: chili!  We begin with ingredients... and then the final product.  Very tasty.

I also decided to try my hand at pumpkin pie, which meant I saved my Halloween pumpkin, roasted it (and the seeds), and pureed it in tiny batches in my tiny food processor.  Then froze it.  Eventually I'll make a pie!  Next to the roasted pumpkin is the pie I actually made at the time - apple, I think.
