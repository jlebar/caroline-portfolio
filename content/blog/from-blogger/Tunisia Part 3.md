<span style="font-weight: bold;">Signs and Warnings</span>

Throughout the country we enjoyed the interesting road signs and warning signs.  I think you'll like them as well.

Left: in Arabic and French: SPEED = DANGER

Right: Camel Crossing sign

Left: my favorite sign: a car with an explosion.  I still don't know what it's about.

Right: a stop sign.  Yes, the signs say "Stop," not "Arret"

Left: "Danger: Do not walk on the ruins" with a falling man

Right: "Stars War Scenery" and "Stars War" (mispelled in French).  Everywhere we went, people had signs up stating that the view was supposedly used in Star Wars; usually false.

Left: Carthage Land, a theme park in Hammamet

Right: One of the ubiquitous posters of the current president.  Apparently purple is his favorite color, so there are lots of purple signs everywhere.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Food!</span>

Tunisian food isn't that different from Mediterranean food in general, except that they eat couscous and no pork, and more lamb.

Left: Orangina!  In Arabic!  Right: a fresh date from the date palm oasis

<img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_BPRHjFkCSTM/SbeeiWoR4cI/AAAAAAAAFbo/MOWLr4PhzTo/s1600-h/IMG_1440.JPG"/> <img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BPRHjFkCSTM/SbeezmetWFI/AAAAAAAAFc4/pdm-7fjcBqo/s1600-h/IMG_1870.JPG"/>

Left: Tea with pine nuts;  Right: Tunisian pheasants, running wild in the streets.  Apparently they are good to eat.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Other Interesting Things</span>

Left: column capital, probably Byzantine, in the Great Mosque at Kairouan.  It's been reused and has areas gouged out of it - probably those areas had figures, which aren't allowed in Islamic decoration, so they were removed before the capital was reused.

Right: Desert rose, it's a natural sand formation that the locals dig up and sell to tourists.  They crumble in too much humidity so I didn't buy one.

Left: Tunisian mailbox.  All the official signs are in French.

Right: the Tunisian flag, with a crescent and star for Islam, the color white for purity, and the red is arbitrary  (so said our Tunisian guide).

And that's it!  I hope you enjoyed!
