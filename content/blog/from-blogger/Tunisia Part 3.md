## Signs and Warnings

Throughout the country we enjoyed the interesting road signs and warning signs.  I think you'll like them as well.

## Food!

Tunisian food isn't that different from Mediterranean food in general, except that they eat couscous and no pork, and more lamb.

It's been reused and has areas gouged out of it -- probably those areas had figures, which aren't allowed in Islamic decoration, so they were removed before the capital was reused." >}}
