I've read a lot of pieces about the removal of Confederate monuments from public spaces in the South over the last couple months, and I know this is a difficult topic still for many people.  But I haven't yet seen anyone fully articulate my own thoughts about this, so here's one more foray into the discussion.

The public square is where, I would argue, we put our values on display.  Historically, this has taken the form of church facades, city hall facades, bank facades, monuments, art pieces, flags, etc.  Today we are probably more likely to install an art piece than a monument to a great man (or, less commonly, woman).  We install pieces that speak to our unity, or commemorate tragic losses, or inspire us.
