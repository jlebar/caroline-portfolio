I spend almost half of my class time here in Rome visiting churches, so I thought I would share some of them with you! These photos are an accumulation of images from a variety of class trips for my Baroque and Late Antique/Early Byzantine art history classes.

Santo Stefano Rotondo: one of the rare Early Christian centrally-planned churches (it's a circle on the inside).

St. Paul's Outside-the-Walls, an Early Christian basilica that burned down in the 1800s and was rebuilt as a copy of the original.  It gives you a good sense of how big and monumental churches were in the mid-fourth-century (350s).
