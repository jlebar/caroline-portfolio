Two years ago, I visited the National Building Museum over the summer and experienced their annual summer installation, which at the time was a pink-and-silver mountain of cardboard tubes installed by Studio Gang.  This summer, since I had the opportunity to visit DC again, I was looking forward to what the museum would have installed.  I have to admit that when I saw the installation was called "LAWN," and was advertised as, well, a big lawn, I was disappointed.  I imagined a roll of astroturf unfurled across the enormous great hall and nothing more.  Fortunately, Rockwell Group is more creative when it comes to lawns than I am.
