Where to begin?

My last post was November of 2019, which was also the first post in the new blog format.  I had such plans!  And then, 2020 happened.  Need I say more?  I guess I will anyway: Between moving, and finding a new job, and roughly six weeks after that, the start of the COVID-19 pandemic shelter-in-place here in San Francisco, my priorities changed.  Suddenly I was cooking more - a lot more - and trying to stay connected with friends, virtually, while navigating working from home for the first time.  I am one of the privileged few who was able to make the transition to work from home fairly easily, who was able to keep my job, and who has been able to survive this dumpster fire of a year in general comfort.  I am grateful for that.  But at the same time, I am grieving the loss of family friends and acquaintances, the loss of freedom of movement, of all the little things we enjoyed and moved to San Francisco to experience.  I am also grieving the state of our country, with over 350,000 deaths so far, massive unemployment, continuing racism and discrimination, government ineptitude (although with hope for change coming this month), and many difficult conversations with friends and family over public health compliance and safety.

So - in trying to restart this writing effort, after a year of neglect - where to begin?

Expect several posts to come that sum up my work in 2019, then, hopefully,



After nearly fifteen years of using [Picasa] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasa) as my primary photo software, I've finally admitted that it's gone, and that I have to say goodbye.  Google stopped supporting Picasa in 2016, and this year, the Mac OS update has killed it and it will no longer work at all.  Google acquired and started distributing Picasa in 2004, and I think I've been using it since 2006, so it had a solid run.  Why am I mourning the loss of this program?  It was fast, intuitive, and integrated well with my blogging and photo-sharing workflows; now I have nothing like that.  I could save my photos to my hard drive or external drive, where they would be automatically imported; I could edit, and Picasa would automatically save back-up copies of the original images; and I could export directly from Picasa to Google Web Albums or Blogger or even Snapfish, where my images were then available for easy use.  Of course, this workflow assumed, in some sense, that my photos did not originate on the web to begin with, which was no longer true once I started using a Pixel phone.  But I have never enjoyed editing photos on the web, I prefer to download them to my hard drive for backup purposes anyway, so the workflow still worked well for me.  Besides, Google Photos on the web does not integrate with my massive photo collection on my hard drive, so it's useless as a photo organization software.

I'm going to try using Adobe Bridge as my new photo organization software - we'll see how that goes!  It lacks the approachable and user-friendly interface of Picasa; it lacks the ability to export directly to the web and integrate with online services; but it does have direct integration with Photoshop and Camera Raw, which provide vastly superior editing capabilities compared to Picasa.  Editing has never been my strong suit -- I often use photos unedited -- so this isn't a big improvement for me, but at least it feels like less of a downgrade.  Also, the "collections" feature seems much less intuitive than the albums feature in Picasa, so we'll see if that works well.

There are other photo organization programs out there, like digikam, and I might give them a try.  But I will always appreciate the many years of photo organization that I enjoyed with Picasa.
