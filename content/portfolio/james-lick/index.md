The Building 900 -- Student Center renovation for James Lick High School included demolition of existing structures, the careful adaptation of the existing cafeteria and kitchen, and addition of a new library.  The resulting center creates a new heart for student activities on campus, including dining, studying, counseling, and administration.  A new outdoor courtyard with custom shade trellis marks the center of campus and invites students to gather, learn, and socialize in an environment that fosters community pride.
