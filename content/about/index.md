Caroline S. Lebar, AIA, LEED AP BD+C, is a licensed architect working in Silicon Valley, California, with a focus on higher education, K-12 public schools, historic preservation, and public interest design.  Her work includes design, construction administration, teaching, and research.  She worked with CAW Architects in Palo Alto from 2013 to 2019, where she led the design and construction of the major renovation of historic Frost Amphitheater at Stanford University.  Her other projects at CAW included renovations of library, administration, student services, and arts buildings for East Side Union High School District in San Jose; award-winning historic preservation work for private clients in Palo Alto; and many other projects in the area.

Outside the office, her work has included teaching design studios at Hampton University's Department of Architecture; Stanford University's Architectural Design Program; and Duke University's TIP Summer Studies Program at Rice University.

Caroline is a graduate of Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) with a Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) degree.  She received a dual A.B. from Duke University in Art History, Concentration in Architecture, and in Philosophy, where her undergraduate thesis discussed the urbanism of medieval monastic architecture in the city of Rome.

Previously, Caroline wrote "Not Built in a Day," a personal blog about architecture, urbanism, and the built environment.  That blog was active from 2008-2019 until it was incorporated into this site.  In addition to writing about cities, Caroline's writing includes reviews of books, films, and exhibitions; travelogues; and miscellaneous attempts at humor.
