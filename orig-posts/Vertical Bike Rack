(Of course, there are also tons of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Bike-Tree/">DIY versions</a>&nbsp;out there, most of them pretty ugly and involving lots of pieces of wood.) &nbsp;The result is as you see:<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />1 4'x8' sheet of plywood<br />1 4x4 square post<br />2 angle brackets<br />2 bike hooks<br />a bunch of screws<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8PfdsOcRPnk/UtjgfBuwxBI/AAAAAAAADBM/D4wdjtS6RkM/s1600/IMG_20140116_230131.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8PfdsOcRPnk/UtjgfBuwxBI/AAAAAAAADBM/D4wdjtS6RkM/s1600/IMG_20140116_230131.jpg" height="320" width="240" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fshWzk-UUJg/UtjggOoltdI/AAAAAAAADBQ/xaVFUMhrNa0/s1600/IMG_20140116_230104.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fshWzk-UUJg/UtjggOoltdI/AAAAAAAADBQ/xaVFUMhrNa0/s1600/IMG_20140116_230104.jpg" height="240" width="320" /></a></div><br />We cut the post and plywood down to size at Home Depot, and then at home, screwed it all together with a power drill. &nbsp;The bike hooks required us to pre-drill holes into the post and then screw them in by hand. &nbsp;The end result is a surprisingly stable and sturdy rack, that sits against the wall for extra stability but is actually free-standing. &nbsp;The trick was to design it so the weight of the bikes goes straight down through the bikes to the floor, rather than pulling on the rack itself. &nbsp;The hooks keep the bikes from rolling away. &nbsp;You could try installing the hooks higher so the bikes hang by the front wheels, rather than rest on their rear wheels, but this seemed safer. &nbsp;All the screws are on the back of the rack, going through the plywood into the post, so the final result is pretty clean. &nbsp;If you're interested in making your own and need some tips, let me know! &nbsp;It's pretty simple to build!<br /><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZzTnbvXJvn4/UtjgdsGMnAI/AAAAAAAADBA/m8Gbf8EKb1k/s1600/IMG_20140116_230541.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZzTnbvXJvn4/UtjgdsGMnAI/AAAAAAAADBA/m8Gbf8EKb1k/s1600/IMG_20140116_230541.jpg" height="320" width="240" /></a></div><div><br /></div></div>
