<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">As part of a program through J's work, J and I will be spending the next four months in Hampton, Virginia, a town in the Virginia Beach - Norfolk - Newport News area, also known as Hampton Roads.&nbsp; J will be teaching first-year computer science at Hampton University, a historically black university (HBCU), as part of the "Google-in-Residence" program.&nbsp; As for me, I have left CAW and will be taking a sabbatical while I figure out what's next for me.&nbsp; Our plan is to return to the Bay Area in January, and move to San Francisco.<br /><br />We left our apartment at the beginning of August, put everything into storage, and left for DC, where J had training before starting his program.&nbsp; I took the opportunity to visit some museums and spend time with friends in the area.<br /><br />Last week we arrived here at Hampton</div>
