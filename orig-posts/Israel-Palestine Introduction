Dear friends,<br /><br />Tonight I leave for a peacemaking trip to Israel/Palestine, led by Craig Hunter, pastor at the Trinity Presbyterian Church of Denton, TX (http://tpcdenton.org/).&nbsp; We will be visiting several towns in the West Bank, including Bethlehem, as well as Nazareth and Jerusalem, and then several of us will be heading over to Jordan to visit Petra.&nbsp; I plan to post my reflections and photos here as I can, and please feel free to comment on the posts if you'd like to respond!&nbsp; Thanks for your well-wishes and prayers, and I can't wait to start sharing our trip with you!<br /><br />In the meantime, here's a before and after picture of my recent haircut, from which I was able to donate 13" of hair to Locks of Love:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HCjuwimDCpY/T7asEK1S2WI/AAAAAAAAAoI/MrqCtkXmB9U/s1600/IMG_5423.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HCjuwimDCpY/T7asEK1S2WI/AAAAAAAAAoI/MrqCtkXmB9U/s320/IMG_5423.jpg" width="213" /></a><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-inwQE4zxJo4/T7asD3csJkI/AAAAAAAAAoA/vrP-iMMa1Go/s1600/IMG_5429.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-inwQE4zxJo4/T7asD3csJkI/AAAAAAAAAoA/vrP-iMMa1Go/s320/IMG_5429.jpg" width="213" /></a></div>
