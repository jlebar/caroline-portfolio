<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Hello from Virginia, our new, albeit temporary, home!<br /><br />As part of a program through J's work, we will be spending the next four months in Hampton, Virginia, a town in the Virginia Beach - Norfolk - Newport News area, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Roads">Hampton Roads</a>.&nbsp; J will be teaching first-year computer science at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_University">Hampton University</a>, a historically black university (HBCU), as part of the <a href="https://careers.google.com/stories/google-in-residence/">Google-in-Residence</a>&nbsp;(GIR) program.&nbsp; As for me, I have left CAW, and will be taking a sabbatical while I figure out what's next.&nbsp; Our plan is to return to the Bay Area in January, and move to San Francisco.<br /><br />We vacated our apartment at the beginning of August, put everything into storage, and left for DC, where J had training before starting at Hampton.&nbsp; While we were sorry to leave our great apartment in Mountain View, I think we were both ready for something new.&nbsp; We also said good-bye to my beloved 2006 Pontiac Vibe, which went to a new home.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

We were able to visit the <a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/">National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC)</a>, twice, so we could actually see the whole thing; it's too much to see in one visit.&nbsp; The museum is organized around two sets of galleries: the lower-level history galleries, and the upper-level culture galleries.&nbsp; I spent 2.5 hrs on the lower level galleries, which trace the history of African Americans in the US since the first slaves were brought to the colonies, through the present.&nbsp; Then I spent 3 hrs on the upper level galleries, which showcase African American culture thematically, organized around music, performing arts, visual art, community activism, and sports.&nbsp; The exhibits integrate artifacts, text, photographs, video, and music throughout, creating an immersive experience that makes it easy to get lost for hours.&nbsp; If you haven't had a chance to visit yet, since the museum opened in 2016, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />We also visited the National Portrait Gallery (to see the recently-installed <a href="https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.2018.16">Obama portraits</a>), the National Botanical Garden, Dupont Circle area, the District Wharf, and the Air &amp; Space Museum.&nbsp; I also visited the "Lawn" exhibit at the National Building Museum, but that deserves a separate post.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tukVYFu9tKM/XV1lvahobmI/AAAAAAAAevM/yM89AKz8RCgEUGnLDtAECMKtmjfLGESVACKgBGAs/s1600/IMG_20190804_112053.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

I recommend the <a href="https://www.thecharmery.com/">Charmery</a> ice cream shop if you're in the neighborhood!&nbsp; I got a Cheerwine milkshake that was excellent on a hot day.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Thanks to GIR, we have a furnished apartment for the time we're here.&nbsp; So far we have been focused on getting settled in, finding the closest grocery stores, etc, while J meets the Hampton CS Department faculty and I work on my portfolio.&nbsp; My hope is to get involved with the Hampton Department of Architecture, or work part-time on construction administration in a local firm, or some combination of the two.&nbsp; I also have a backlog of writing and personal projects to tackle -- including, probably, a new blog/website -- so look forward to seeing that!<br /><br />So far, we've visited the Virginia Air &amp; Space Center / NASA Langley Visitor Center, checked out the beach and a local seafood festival, and are planning to attend some of the <a href="http://hamptonva2019.com/">1619 Commemoration</a> events (recognizing 400 years since the first African landing in Virginia) this weekend.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Let me know if you're interested, and we hope to see some of you during our time here.&nbsp; Also, if you have any recommendations for what we *have to* see and do while in Virginia, let me know in the comments!&nbsp; I'm already planning on trips to NYC, Durham, Richmond, and Williamsburg, but would welcome more suggestions.</div>
