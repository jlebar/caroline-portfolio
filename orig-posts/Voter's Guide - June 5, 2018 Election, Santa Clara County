<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">If you're like me, you spend a lot of time figuring out who to vote for, because there is no single place to get all the voter information you need.&nbsp; So, since I have already spent the last several hours deciding how to vote, I've compiled all the information I used here, so you can decide for yourself!&nbsp; This is relevant to the Santa Clara County election here in California, so if you are looking for San Francisco-specific information, you can try <a href="https://www.spur.org/voter-guide/2018-06">SPUR</a> or other sources.&nbsp; Obvious disclaimer:&nbsp; I am looking for progressive candidates who support strong liberal policies on the environment, housing, education, human rights, and the economy.&nbsp; If you disagree with me, you may want to look elsewhere.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

National Offices</u></b><br /><br />Governor:&nbsp; Gavin Newsom<br />Former SF mayor Gavin Newsom has an almost <a href="https://gavinnewsom.com/housing">overwhelming amount of policy objectives</a>, all with detailed descriptions, that gives me confidence that he (and his campaign) are ready for this job.&nbsp; Here's the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/The-Chronicle-endorsement-Gavin-Newsom-for-12902013.php">editorial describing the race</a>.&nbsp; The other plausible candidates are Antonio Villaraigosa, Delaine Eastin, and John Chiang.&nbsp; I also liked <a href="http://shellenberger.org/housing/">Michael Shellenberger</a> - if you think (as I do) that housing is a critical issue, he's even more on the vanguard of YIMBYism than Newsom.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he seems never to have held elective office, and almost certainly cannot win.&nbsp; But if you prefer a protest vote, he might be your man.&nbsp; (More on <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/What-makes-Democrats-run-besides-loathing-12754144.php">why there are so many progressive candidates for governor and other offices without any experience here</a>.)<br /><br />Lieutenant Governor: Jeff Bleich<br />Mr. Bleich seems qualified, interested in the position, and I like that he has been <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-Jeff-Bleich-for-California-lieutenant-12815579.php">described as careful and patient</a>.&nbsp; His opponents Eleni Kounalakis and Ed Hernandez also have reasonable candidate statements, though, so consider them as well.<br /><br />Secretary of State: Alex Padilla (incumbent)<br />Has the most reasonable candidate statement, seems to be doing a good job<br /><br />Controller: Betty Yee (incumbent)<br />Has the most reasonable candidate statement, seems to be doing a good job<br /><br />Treasurer: Fiona Ma<br />Based on reading the candidate statements, she is the only reasonable choice.&nbsp; Also recommended by SF Chronicle.<br /><br />Attorney General: Xavier Becerra (incumbent)<br />Has a very reasonable candidate statement, and seems to be doing a good job.&nbsp; His opponent, Dave Jones, was Insurance Commissioner, so he's not a bad choice either.&nbsp; Here's <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-Xavier-Becerra-is-the-right-choice-for-12871133.php">an editorial on why to keep Becerra in his post</a>.<br /><br />Insurance Commissioner: Steve Poizner<br />Based on reading the candidate statements, he is the only reasonable choice.&nbsp; Also recommended by SF Chronicle.<br /><br />State Board of Equalization, District 2: Malia Cohen<br />I wasn't aware until now, but apparently this state tax board is on the way out.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/09/editorial-pick-cohen-for-tax-board-that-should-be-shut-down/">Here's the article describing why it should be eliminated</a> but why in the meantime, Malia Cohen is the best candidate.<br /><br />Superintendent of Public Instruction: Marshall Tuck<br /><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-Marshall-Tuck-for-state-schools-chief-12795145.php">Based on this editorial</a><br />Tony Thurmond also has a compelling candidacy and strong candidate statement, but I was persuaded by the argument that he failed to vote on at least one key educational issue as a state legislator.&nbsp; If you think the status quo on education in California is not that bad, though, then he may be your candidate.<br /><br />US Senator: Dianne Feinstein (incumbent)<br />There's a lot to say about this race, so I will just direct to you <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-Chronicle-Recommends-Dianne-Feinstein-12833238.php">a better treatment than I can give</a>.&nbsp; Senator Feinstein is quite old (at 84), but she is powerful, and her interests are generally aligned with my own.&nbsp; I trust her more than her opponent, Kevin de Leon, to get things done, at a time when it is very difficult for Democrats to get anything done at the federal level.&nbsp; However, if you oppose her support for various software-related measures that, for example, make it easier for the government to have a backdoor into your computer - then you should consider Mr. de Leon.<br /><br />US Representative, District 18: Anna Eshoo (incumbent)<br />Has the most reasonable candidate statement, seems to be doing an ok job based on her recent&nbsp;<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Anna_Eshoo">voting record</a><br /><b><br /></b><b><u>Local Offices</u></b><br /><br />State Assembly, District 24: Marc Berman (incumbent)<br />Assemblyman&nbsp; Berman's candidate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.voteberman.com/">website</a> is frankly embarrassing.&nbsp; He seems not to have updated it since he was elected in 2016.&nbsp; Does his team not realize that he has to run again every two years?&nbsp; As of today, just days before the election, his website homepage still has a message of thanks for everyone who helped in his 2016 campaign.&nbsp; Still, he is better than the other two fairly distateful alternatives.&nbsp; His <a href="https://a24.asmdc.org/">official state website</a> notes his recent work.<br /><br />Judge of Superior Court, Office No. 4: Vincent Chiarello, uncontested<br /><br />Recall of Judge Aaron Persky: No.<br />This is a somewhat tricky issue, because I can understand why people are angry about Judge Persky's lenient sentencing of sex offenders.&nbsp; At issue, though, to my mind, is if he is following the law or not, since I do believe we must uphold judicial independence.&nbsp; So following t<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-The-case-against-the-recall-of-Judge-12587849.php">he recommendations of this article</a>, I am voting against his recall.<br /><br />Candidates to Succeed Judge Persky: Cindy Seeley Hendrickson, Assistant District Attorney<br />Here's <a href="https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2018/05/11/candidates-for-perskys-seat-steer-clear-of-turner-case">a review of both candidates</a>.&nbsp; Hendrickson appears to have the most relevant experience of the two, although both candidates seem reasonable.<br /><br />County Assessor: <a href="https://www.sccassessor.org/index.php/about-us/about-our-accessor/assessor-profile">Larry Stone</a>, uncontested<br /><br />District Attorney: <a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/da/aboutus/aboutthedistrictattorney/Pages/default.aspx">Jeff Rosen</a>, uncontested<br /><br />Sheriff: John Hirokawa<br />The incumbent is Sheriff Laurie Smith, who has been in office for many years now.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/08/santa-clara-co-sheriff-faces-fiercest-election-challenge-in-two-decade-tenure/">Based on this editorial</a>, I think it's time to let someone else have a go at it.&nbsp; Undersheriff Hirokawa seems well qualified and would be a welcome change of command.<br /><br /><b><u>Ballot Measures</u></b><br /><br />Prop 68: Yes<br />I generally support bond funding for environmental causes - parks, water supply, etc.<br /><br />Prop 69: Yes<br />This is mostly an administrative issue that ensures that taxes collected (on transportation) that were intended for a certain purpose are actually used for that purpose (for transportation).<br /><br />Prop 70: No<br />This would change the votes required to spend cap-and-trade monies from a simple majority to a 2/3 majority.&nbsp; That seems like a very bad idea.&nbsp; We should not restrict how cap-and-trade proceeds are spent by a supermajority.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-Chronicle-recommendations-on-Props-12849416.php">More on this confusing proposition here.</a><br /><br />Prop 71: Yes<br />This one streamlines how ballot measures are implemented.<br /><br />Prop 72: Yes<br />This one exempts rainwater capture facilities from increasing your property taxes.&nbsp; Solar installations are already exempt.&nbsp; This seems ok in order to incentivize the creation of rainwater capture facilities.<br /><br />Regional Measure 3: Yes<br />Increases bridge tolls to provide funding for regional transit measures.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.spur.org/voter-guide/2018-06/measure-3-bridge-toll">Here is SPUR's good analysis of this one</a>.<br /><br />Mountain View - Los Altos Union HSD Bond Measure E: Yes<br />I build schools.&nbsp; I support bond funding to help build schools.&nbsp; Enough said.<br /><br />**************************************************************<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dpvUnCQ3-jA/WwtOERA7ouI/AAAAAAAAUU8/6PAUc1c-7wgDxlKDFGQTCRqhTJWSqm18ACKgBGAs/s1600/IMG_20170121_160630.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

And for those curious, here is more information about my research methods.<br /><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />Note that I typically followed this pattern for finding information:<br />1. Read the state-issed "<a href="http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/pdf/complete-vig.pdf">Official Voter Information Guide</a>."&nbsp; This guide only applies to state-wide elections, though.&nbsp; It has candidate statements from most candidates, and summaries, with for and against positions, on all the statewide ballot measures.&nbsp; (If the PDF doesn't open, here's the source for the pdf:&nbsp;http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/)<br />2.&nbsp; Read editorials (San Jose Mercury-News, SF Chronicle, LA Times) about the candidates<br />3.&nbsp; Look up individual candidate websites<br />4.&nbsp; For the ballot measures, I also consulted SPUR and&nbsp;<a href="https://caleja.org/2018/03/2018-environmental-justice-voter-guide/">this environmental website</a><br /><div>5.&nbsp; Finally, I relied on this good general guide:&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.sfchronicle.com/2018/voter-guide/">https://projects.sfchronicle.com/2018/voter-guide/</a>; and here's the guide from the LA Times, for comparison:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/endorsements/la-ed-endorsements-20180518-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/opinion/endorsements/la-ed-endorsements-20180518-story.html</a></div></div>
