<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">If you're like me, you've been wondering what to do with yourself since Season 7 of <i>Doctor Who</i> ended in May.&nbsp; Since we still have practically an eternity to go until the November 23rd 50th anniversary special, I thought I'd help out with a handy list of ways to pass the time until then.<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Cry.&nbsp; I can't believe Matt Smith is leaving.&nbsp; I will miss his hair.<br />2.&nbsp; Find a local <i>Doctor Who</i> fan club, so you can cry together about the fact that November is so far away.&nbsp; Sooo far....<br />3.&nbsp; Cry while re-watching recent <i>Doctor Who</i> episodes.&nbsp; (The end of <i>Vincent and the Doctor</i> always kills me.&nbsp; Also every season finale episode, ever.)<br />4.&nbsp; Do laundry?&nbsp; Or something useful?<br />5.&nbsp; Watch all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials">nearly 700 previous episodes</a> of classic <i>Doctor Who</i>.&nbsp; Or watch them again, depending on your age.&nbsp; I started from the beginning in June, and have managed to finish seasons 1, 7, and 8, plus a random selection of episodes from other seasons.&nbsp; I'm currently on season 10, with the Third Doctor.&nbsp; More on that later.<br />6.&nbsp; Stop crying long enough to reflect on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Capaldi">Peter Capaldi</a> and what he will bring to the show.<br />7.&nbsp; Resume crying.&nbsp; I miss the Ponds.<br />8.&nbsp; Get a different hobby, like guitar, or macrame?<br />9.&nbsp; Figure out the best way to watch <i>Doctor Who</i> legally.&nbsp; I don't have cable (or a TV for that matter), so I don't get BBC America.&nbsp; I don't have Netflix, or Amazon Prime, or any other internet TV service.&nbsp; While I'm contemplating signing up for one of these, I'm not sure which one has the most <i>Who</i> for the buck.&nbsp; Should I just give up and buy the DVD box sets, so I can own copies of <i>Doctor Who</i> forever?&nbsp; And besides that, how am I going to watch new episodes without a TV?&nbsp; These are important questions to answer before the next season.&nbsp; Let me know if you have suggestions.&nbsp; Note: volunteering your own TV for weekly group DW-watching is an acceptable solution.&nbsp; Otherwise I might have to go all the way up to SF to watch with the local DW group.<br /><br />And finally,<br />10.&nbsp; Cry over your inability to do anything except wait impatiently for more <i>Doctor Who</i>.&nbsp; Come on, November...<br /><br /></div>
