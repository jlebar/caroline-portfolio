<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">This past weekend, we went to Vancouver for a few days so that J could participate in Lindy Bout.&nbsp; I went along to see the sights and visit with college friends who live nearby.&nbsp; I would try to say something cute about the weather, but I think my humor would be too dry for this climate.&nbsp; Suffice to say, it rained some of the time, but I didn't let it dampen my spirits.&nbsp; For the full photo set, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ep1fGuLB6Z7y7Gg6A">use this link.</a><br /><br />We arrived Thursday night after a delayed flight, and took the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkyTrain_(Vancouver)">SkyTrain</a> and bus to our Airbnb close to Granville Island.&nbsp; J went to dance, and I went to bed.<br /><br /><b>Friday</b><br />Our Airbnb host was excellent and gave us an orientation and suggestions for places to check out.&nbsp; I started the day with a blueberry-jasmine croissant from <a href="http://www.beaucoupbakery.com/">Beaucoup Bakery</a>, which he recommended, and which was just a couple blocks away.&nbsp; The croissant was delicious, and I got crumbs everywhere while waiting for the bus to downtown.&nbsp; The bus ride was less than 15 minutes and put me right in the middle of downtown.<br /><br />My first event of the day was a walking tour with Erik from <a href="https://www.tourguys.ca/tour/free-walking-tour-vancouver-downtown-waterfront/">Tour Guys</a>.&nbsp; He was knowledgeable and interesting, covering a wide range of Vancouver history.&nbsp; We visited the Hotel Vancouver, Christ Church Cathedral, the Marine Building, and Canada Place / Vancouver Convention Center, admiring some public art, parks, and plazas along the way.&nbsp; The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Building">Marine Building</a> was the stand-out by far, with its incredibly detailed Art Deco ornament both inside and out.&nbsp; &nbsp;Be sure to visit the lobby and check out the elevator doors and interiors (wood inlay, brass), ceramic tile work, terrazzo flooring, and decorative stucco.&nbsp; The entire building is marine-themed, with Viking ships, ships of famous explorers, signs of the Zodiac (for navigation), etc.&nbsp; The architect was McCarnter Nairne, a local firm.&nbsp; At Canada Place, we went to the downstairs lobbies and viewed some art pieces by local artists and some displays about local history.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

I later tried their chocolate bars (I picked up a few for later), and would highly recommend checking them out - they roast, temper, and make their bars all in house.&nbsp; At this point, it started to rain, and continued raining through the rest of the day.&nbsp; Armed with my umbrella, I visited the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Sun_Yat-Sen_Classical_Chinese_Garden">Sun Yat-Sen Park</a> (and skipped the garden), walked around <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Place">BC Place</a>, and finished at the <a href="https://www.vpl.ca/">Vancouver Public Library</a>.&nbsp; I was interested in BC Place for its retractable roof, which I studied as part of my work on the Frost Amphitheater at Stanford.&nbsp; Unfortunately there were no public tours of the inside of the stadium available while I was there, so I just tried to get the best view I could from the outside.&nbsp; The library was quite impressive as well, with an outdoor roof terrace, a stadium seating area on the top floors, computer labs full of people, art displays, musical instruments on loan, and all kinds of interesting nooks and places to sit.&nbsp; By the end of the afternoon, my socks were soaked through thanks to my decidedly non-waterproof shoes, and I was ready to head home.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Sy9DiZjhvVs/XKq4urJpYnI/AAAAAAAAbJc/WxfLRkqH1GsJFA5NZgEBO3JiE5qmdSUywCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG_20190405_124826.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

My local friend came with me and we enjoyed the interactive art installations by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mowry_Baden">Mowry Baden</a>, including a set of mop buckets cast in bronze, a weird pile of hand trucks that you can push around, a spinning thing that you use by lying on it on your stomach, a "DIY Yayoi Kusama Infinity Room" (my name for it) of a darkened room with annoying flashing lights that shoots ping pong balls past you, and more.&nbsp; Fun times were had by all.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y67IDr_O4D4/XKq45XoXQLI/AAAAAAAAbJg/NolQnYRSPFQXkS26CGpsrbKREkEL5WHtgCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG_20190405_193225.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

I had the orange and the apple cinnamon waffles, with a side of whipped cream and custard; J had the plain Belgian waffle with a side of poached pears in caramel sauce.&nbsp; Both were extremely sweet and indulgent - one side of poached pears would have been plenty for two plain waffles.&nbsp; But everything was delicious so I can't complain.&nbsp; The shop is set incongruously amid a sea of high-end car dealerships / repair shops, so don't be confused if you are looking for it!<br /><br />We then took a quick walk around Granville Island and the public market before meeting our friend for the main event of the day, which was a trip to <a href="https://www.capbridge.com/">Capilano Suspension Bridge Park</a>.&nbsp; The drive was short - everything is so close together! - and the weather was remarkably cooperative.&nbsp; It rained briefly while we were there, but not enough to stop us.&nbsp; The park is fairly "Disneyfied" with little shops and food kiosks everywhere, but I guess that helps pays for the attractions, which are a series of canopy and cliff walks built high in the trees and cantilevered from the cliffside.&nbsp; And, of course, there is the suspension bridge that started it all, which is really a fun piece of infrastructure, spanning across a canyon with a rushing river at the bottom.&nbsp; The bridge bounces and sways quite a bit as you walk across, so it's certainly not for anyone who's afraid of heights or can't handle unstable surfaces.&nbsp; Once across, the rest of the park on that side is very easy to access, though, so it would be a good trip for folks with somewhat limited mobility, assuming they can get across the bridge.&nbsp; The canopy walk reminded me of the zipline adventure we did in the redwoods in California - these are the same, or similar, trees - but without the ziplining; there are a series of platforms built onto the trees, and you walk on suspension walkways between them.&nbsp; The little platforms also reminded me strongly of Endor from Star Wars... definitely a plus for me!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

J and I brought sandwiches from Beaucoup Bakery, which were surprisingly good.&nbsp; I had a roasted yam and tomato sandwich on a croissant, J had smoked salmon on brioche.&nbsp; The yam was smoky and spicy and actually made a great sandwich.<br /><br />Back on the entrance side of the canyon, the cliff walk was our group's favorite part of the park, so don't skip that.&nbsp; (An aside - I heard from several people that the free Lynn Canyon Park is equally good, but I can't attest to it myself.&nbsp; Let me know if you go there!)&nbsp; All in all, Capilano is a bit pricey, but if you're really into engineering works and enjoy being up high, this is a worthwhile trip.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

We had a view of the harbor and everyone enjoyed their fish.&nbsp; Then my friends and I went to see an improv show at the <a href="https://www.vtsl.com/">TheaterSports League</a>, and there was much rejoicing.&nbsp; It's an inexpensive and fun show, and they serve alcohol, if you're into that.&nbsp; We had our own little table in the front.&nbsp; My friends advised that the regular, daily improv show, which is a series of different improv sketches (like Whose Line Is It Anyway) is generally better than their single-theme shows.<br /><br /><b>Sunday</b><br />I slept in again - what is a vacation if not a chance to sleep? - and then grabbed breakfast at Their There, a breakfast/lunch spot down 4th from the Airbnb.&nbsp; I didn't really enjoy my granola and yogurt, since the yogurt was aggressively sour and the granola &amp; fruit topping did not compensate nearly enough.&nbsp; But I also got an apple danish for J, which I wasn't able to get to him before I had to leave, and ended up eating it myself; the danish was excellent, very flaky and delicious.&nbsp; The shop is extremely hip(ster) and had the music pumping for a Sunday morning.<br /><br />After breakfast I took the bus downtown again and met my friend for the 10:30am service at <a href="https://thecathedral.ca/">Christ Church Cathedral</a>.&nbsp; As an Anglican church, the services are very "high church," but I enjoyed the bit of pomp and circumstance, and the lovely choir and organ music.&nbsp; After church we headed over to Yaletown and walked around until we met the others for lunch at The Distillery.&nbsp; I had basic fried eggs on toast and breakfast potatoes, which were good but not anything special.<br /><br />We then said goodbye to our friends, and I spent the afternoon walking around Kitsilano until it was time to catch the bus to the airport.&nbsp; I walked down to the beach, around the point past the Maritime Museum and Museum of Vancouver, and back along 4th.&nbsp; I stopped to get a hot chocolate at <a href="https://kokomonk.com/">Koko Monk Chocolates</a>, which was a small, slightly off-putting shop (the windows have giant signs indicating that they are VEGAN and RAW) but had pretty darn delicious hot chocolate.&nbsp; I got the "authentic" (unflavored) one, which was still very flavorful, with orange flavors and spices added, whipped cream, and a very thick chocolate sauce on top.&nbsp; I'd be curious to try their other flavors next time, since they have a long list of unusual flavors to try.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Public transit has been exceptional here, the buses are fast, frequent and clean, the trains quiet and easy to navigate.&nbsp; A+, Vancouver.&nbsp; I got to the airport in no time, then got through security reasonably quickly with my Global Entry card.&nbsp; And then, I waited.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the American security area has pretty disappointing food choices, so I had a mediocre banh mi while waiting for my flight.&nbsp; My flight back was delayed an hour, just like our flight there.&nbsp; Oh well.<br /><br /><b>Conclusions</b><br />And that, my friends, was Vancouver!&nbsp; A few general thoughts:&nbsp; I found the city to be very clean, well-kept, and friendly - at least, the parts that I visited.&nbsp; It was also easy to navigate and compact enough to walk easily.&nbsp; I did notice a more distinct lack of accessibility than I would have expected, specifically in newer buildings where I would have expected more; doors didn't have clearance at the sides, lots of stairs everywhere, etc.&nbsp; But then again, the specific regulations of the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) don't apply in Canada, so maybe their disability groups have different priorities or requirements?&nbsp; I did see gender-neutral restrooms or single-accommodation restrooms nearly everywhere, which was nice to see.&nbsp; The weather was also very cooperative, waiting until later in the afternoon or evening to rain, and I even got some legitimately sunny weather on Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; The cherry trees were blooming, it wasn't too cold, and what more could one ask for!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cl6s6YB_Npg/XKq7OPkc2_I/AAAAAAAAbKo/5Ddkk8q4bU83fHtz3nVMDua6dIj8wyhVgCKgBGAs/s1600/IMG_20190407_150830.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

the Museum of Anthropology / UBC campus, hiking / mountains, taking the ferries, etc.&nbsp; So I shall just have to plan to visit again.&nbsp; &nbsp;What else did I miss?&nbsp; Tell me in the comments!</div>
