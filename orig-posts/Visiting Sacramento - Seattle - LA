<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Just for the record: &nbsp;I'm an architect!<br /><br />And now, I shall attempt to catch up with all the posts I meant to do this summer, but didn't, because I was too busy working on becoming an architect.<br /><br />This summer I had the great pleasure of attending the weddings of two friends, in Sacramento and Seattle, and a Weird Al concert in Los Angeles. &nbsp;These short trips gave me the chance to see more of the cities of the West Coast. &nbsp;While I had been to Seattle before, it was back in 2007, and I didn't spend that much time in the city. &nbsp;I'd never been to Sacramento, and in LA, we only went to places I hadn't been before. &nbsp;Many adventures were had!<br /><br /><b>Sacramento</b><br /><br />Our fair state's capitol has a distinct downtown, surrounded by miles of sprawl. &nbsp;In downtown we were pleased to find a silly hipster vegetarian restaurant for lunch, called <a href="http://mothersacramento.com/">Mother</a>. &nbsp;We had chicken-fried mushrooms (amazing) and some other tasty things. &nbsp;We spent some time walking through the downtown, from the riverfront with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Bridge_(California)">golden bridge</a> to the state capitol, and stayed at a totally hipster motel called <a href="http://www.thegreenshotel.com/">The Greens</a>. &nbsp;The weather was very hot, and unfortunately our room had pretty lousy air conditioning. &nbsp;Overall, I'd say it wasn't the greatest place to stay, but it was adequate. &nbsp;Of course, the wedding was lovely, and it was great to see friends from near and far.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7iN9tDf2_kM/VjmrCnj2wOI/AAAAAAAAH5Y/KL1Z-IiaTTE/s1600/IMG_20150808_153701.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7iN9tDf2_kM/VjmrCnj2wOI/AAAAAAAAH5Y/KL1Z-IiaTTE/s320/IMG_20150808_153701.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pzbRCAVPNnM/VjmrCgraBWI/AAAAAAAAH5Y/LVbWGd1kxNo/s1600/IMG_20150808_153719.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pzbRCAVPNnM/VjmrCgraBWI/AAAAAAAAH5Y/LVbWGd1kxNo/s320/IMG_20150808_153719.jpg" width="240" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SCSVAPCBfBk/VjmrCktSkBI/AAAAAAAAH5Y/yTOBp5yVt8M/s1600/IMG_20150808_160006.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SCSVAPCBfBk/VjmrCktSkBI/AAAAAAAAH5Y/yTOBp5yVt8M/s320/IMG_20150808_160006.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jAt1bjDsAhk/VjmrCjuMgXI/AAAAAAAAH5Y/rusOHKVuoKs/s1600/IMG_20150808_160024.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="190" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-jAt1bjDsAhk/VjmrCjuMgXI/AAAAAAAAH5Y/rusOHKVuoKs/s320/IMG_20150808_160024.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><b>Seattle</b><br /><br />Our trip to Seattle was over Labor Day weekend, so we had more time to explore. &nbsp;We checked out the very hip neighborhood of Fremont (see a pattern here...?) and the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Troll">Bridge Troll</a>; walked through <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/parks/park_detail.asp?id=293">Gas Works Park</a>; and played a little ping pong at the Google office. &nbsp;We discovered exactly how much of chocolate snobs we are when we visited the <a href="https://www.theochocolate.com/">Theo </a>factory store and were unimpressed by their samples (which, to be fair, are vast and probably delicious if you're used to Hershey's). &nbsp;On the holiday Monday, we checked out downtown, where I was disappointed to realize that I couldn't go inside the famous Seattle Public Library because it was closed for the holiday. &nbsp;Oh well, I'll have to come back! &nbsp;We drove over to the other side of the sound, for a view back toward the city, and then it was time to head home. &nbsp;This was another lovely wedding weekend, and we were very fortunate to have gotten to attend!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zLwBA2OGNew/VjmrJ8yTljI/AAAAAAAAH5g/VM1KteoE9u0/s1600/IMG_20150906_132636.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zLwBA2OGNew/VjmrJ8yTljI/AAAAAAAAH5g/VM1KteoE9u0/s320/IMG_20150906_132636.jpg" width="240" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PCFyvr-afH0/VjmrJwgbHHI/AAAAAAAAH5g/yhAiVW7z5_4/s1600/IMG_20150906_135635.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PCFyvr-afH0/VjmrJwgbHHI/AAAAAAAAH5g/yhAiVW7z5_4/s320/IMG_20150906_135635.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SlxmMbMbiYA/VjmrJ4ZaxnI/AAAAAAAAH5g/Qjicb_ydg9I/s1600/IMG_20150906_135640.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SlxmMbMbiYA/VjmrJ4ZaxnI/AAAAAAAAH5g/Qjicb_ydg9I/s320/IMG_20150906_135640.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YeZm9t1iXo8/Vm-i125SyMI/AAAAAAAAIhE/Gm1j_GaXV8s/s1600/IMG_20150907_153834.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YeZm9t1iXo8/Vm-i125SyMI/AAAAAAAAIhE/Gm1j_GaXV8s/s320/IMG_20150907_153834.jpg" width="240" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4J2Yj61q9lk/Vm-i1cee-TI/AAAAAAAAIhA/4InywhIOg8I/s1600/IMG_20150907_153817.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4J2Yj61q9lk/Vm-i1cee-TI/AAAAAAAAIhA/4InywhIOg8I/s320/IMG_20150907_153817.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><b>Los Angeles</b><br /><br />During this weekend trip, we visited the Getty Museum (you only pay for parking - what a deal!), the Griffith Observatory, and the Greek Theater (for the concert). &nbsp;Weird Al was excellent, he's a great entertainer and I enjoy his parodies more than the actual songs he's parodying. &nbsp;Richard Meier's <a href="http://www.getty.edu/visit/center/">Getty Museum</a> architecture is very odd, with many pointless architectural follies, but you can get a great view of the city from up there. &nbsp;We didn't go through all the galleries - another time, hopefully - but did go to the special exhibit on Hellenistic bronzes. &nbsp;It was bizarre to see the same statues I've seen before in Rome and other Italian cities on display, in one room, in LA. &nbsp;But also very cool! &nbsp;I was surprised at how many I still recognized from my art history classes, and from seeing in their "natural habitats" in Italy. &nbsp;The <a href="http://griffithobservatory.org/">Griffith Observatory</a> was another great spot from which to view the city, and was thankfully air conditioned on an extremely hot day. &nbsp;The displays were not particularly interesting, but hey, it's free! &nbsp;In keeping with my hipster food preferences, we did check out some tasty places: <a href="http://saltandstraw.com/">Salt &amp; Straw</a>, where I got a coupon for a free float because they accidentally served me one with bad root beer in it; Bouchon Bistro, where we got free pastry treats because they lost our order and it took over an hour to get our food; and <a href="http://www.miloandolive.com/">Milo &amp; Olive</a>, where I had an excellent fruit tart. &nbsp;Tasty food all around, and no regrets for the series of mishaps.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sVxAiE_5p40/VjmqmPjo9-I/AAAAAAAAH5M/k3DAUwWhYtk/s1600/IMG_20150919_191114.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sVxAiE_5p40/VjmqmPjo9-I/AAAAAAAAH5M/k3DAUwWhYtk/s320/IMG_20150919_191114.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gzCTH3LNtsw/VjmqmPOcWPI/AAAAAAAAH5M/uhn3LTVEsJo/s1600/IMG_20150919_155220.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gzCTH3LNtsw/VjmqmPOcWPI/AAAAAAAAH5M/uhn3LTVEsJo/s320/IMG_20150919_155220.jpg" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">This photo brought to you by "WTF Richard Meier." &nbsp;Also by "Masonry...
