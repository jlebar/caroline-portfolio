<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">So you know how sports people are always talking about "fantasy football" or "fantasy baseball" or whatever? &nbsp;It turns out that they aren't talking about a sports team filled with characters from fantasy novels or films. &nbsp;(That <i>would </i>be so much more awesome, I know!) &nbsp;What they mean instead is that they are "fantasizing" about the best team ever, in which they select the players for the different positions from any team. &nbsp;(Or something like that, the specific workings escape me.) &nbsp;Well, in the spirit of these fantasy sports enthusiasts, I would like to propose a fantasy architectural film festival, which would include all the films I'd like to show, if I had infinite time and an extremely patient audience. &nbsp;Here we go!<br /><br /><u>Obviously</u><br />Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream Home<br />Blade Runner<br />The Truman Show<br />Metropolis<br />Labyrinth<br /><u><br /></u><u>The Heroic Architect</u><br />The Towering Inferno<br />Inception<br />The Fountainhead*<br />(ok, yes, it's a short category, we aren't very heroic.)<br /><div><br /></div><u>They're in the Walls</u><br />Die Hard<br />Brazil<br />The Matrix<br />The Italian Job<br />Ocean's Eleven<br />Mission: Impossible<br />Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets<br />Pretty much all the heist films<br /><br /><u>If You Build It, We Will Destroy It With Special Effects</u><br />Earthquake<br />The Towering Inferno (yes, again)<br />The Day After Tomorrow<br />Twister (ok, so it's mostly fields, cows, and cars that get destroyed, but some buildings do too!)<br />Escape From New York**<br />Ghostbusters***<br />Jumanji (omg when the floor turns into quicksand?? or when the whole house basically becomes a jungle?? so cool)<br />Pretty much all the disaster movies<br />Lots of superhero movies (and I'm looking at you, Transformers franchise)<br /><br /><u>It's the Future, Stupid</u><br />THX-1138<br />Logan's Run<br /><br />Of course, there are dozens of other movies where architecture plays a starring role, rather than the part of an extra. &nbsp;These are just the best ones that I can think of right now. &nbsp;Also many of the films above could fall into more than one category, so feel free to watch them more than once. &nbsp;I would.<br /><br />This post <strike>brought to you by</strike> inspired by <a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/breaking-out-and-breaking-in.html">Geoff Manaugh at BLDGBLOG</a>.<br /><br />(*ironically)<br />(**not actually filmed in New York)<br />(***at least partially filmed in New York)</div>
