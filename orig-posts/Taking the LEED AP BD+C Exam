<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Last weekend I took the LEED AP Building Design&nbsp;+ Construction (BD+C) exam, and, mercifully, passed. &nbsp;(Something to be thankful for this Thanksgiving!) &nbsp;I have two purposes in this post: first, to describe my study process for anyone else who's interested, and second, to reflect on the exam at a higher level, to consider whether it's a worthwhile use of one's time.<br /><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">Exam Prep</h4>I passed the LEED Green Associate exam back in 2013, at the end of graduate school, and have been maintaining my credential since then through continuing ed and actual project experience. &nbsp;I recently completed the LEED certification process for two projects at my office and am working on a third. &nbsp;Overall, I felt that I had a solid foundation of understanding coming in to the exam prep. &nbsp;I gave myself two months to prepare and used two different study guides: Gang Chen's "LEED v4 BD+C Exam Guide," plus his sample test book, and Fulya Kocak Gin's "LEED AP BD+C Exam Preparation Guide." &nbsp;I also read all of the reference materials listed in the Candidate Handbook from GBCI, but skimmed the actual LEED BD+C Reference Guide rather than reading it thoroughly.<br /><br />It took me forever to get through Gin's book - but I think without it, I would not have gotten much from Chen's book. &nbsp;The Chen book is sparse, likely because he intends it to be used as a reference manual after the exam and not simply as a study guide; it doesn't contain any exercises or quizzes to help you retain the information. &nbsp;However, it does helpfully condense the amount of material you're trying to memorize. &nbsp;Ultimately, I created my own study sheets that condensed the information even further, to help me memorize just the essentials. &nbsp;I can't say that I recommend either book over the other; it's probably useful to have both, as I did. &nbsp;The Gin book is full of "fluff" (photos, useless charts, etc) but does have quizzes and other information that can help with memorization.<br /><br />I thought both books had terrible sample exams. &nbsp;They both have significant numbers of choose-all-that-apply questions (where you have to choose multiple answers in order to answer the question correctly), but my experience with the actual exam was that it did not have a lot of those type of questions. &nbsp;The calculation questions in Gin's book were much too complex. &nbsp;I scored quite low on both the sample exams, but scored relatively high on the actual exam. &nbsp;So I wouldn't put too much stock in their sample exams, but unfortunately, I don't have any other questions to recommend.<br /><br />The actual exam did involve a lot of rote memorization questions based on the LEED application process, as expected, and the rest were analytical or problem-solving questions related to the same. &nbsp;I thought about 10% of questions were very unclear or difficult. &nbsp;I received a score of 193 out of 200 (170 is the minimum to pass, 125 is the exam minimum), with scores of 75% or higher in each category - so I think my study strategy was effective. &nbsp;Basically I read through both books, took all the sample exams, and then the week before the exam, I created my study guide and read all the reference materials.<br /><h4 style="text-align: left;"><br />Reflections on the Exam</h4>I had a difficult time motivating myself to study for this exam. &nbsp;The exam tests only your memorization and understanding of the LEED certification process -- nothing more. &nbsp;This process is, of course, described in excruciating detail in the LEED Reference Guides, so there is absolutely no reason to memorize it. &nbsp;At all. &nbsp;Ever. &nbsp;So why is there this whole exam and credential system around it? &nbsp;As far as I can tell, it's purely about money, about a system that supports the continued existence of USGBC / GBCI and that, occasionally, results in better pay for the individuals who have gone through the system and earned the credential. &nbsp;You will gain nothing more concrete from the exam preparation process than that.<br /><br />Earning the credential is also, however, a signal that you think LEED, and by extension, sustainable design / green building, is important. &nbsp;It indicates that you have dedicated your time and money to learning about and pursuing design strategies that fight climate change. &nbsp;Even if the primary force behind the credential is money for USGBC / GBCI, the mission of those organizations is to safeguard the planet by changing the way we build and operate buildings. &nbsp;So what kept me going through the snore-inducing pages of point calculations and percent-savings on energy was the thought that getting my LEED credential was an act, however small, of resistance. &nbsp;Since the status quo in our country is apparently climate change denial and business-as-usual, this is one way of joining the opposition movement. &nbsp;While living in California, where we have better-than-average laws and codes to combat global warming, I've sometimes forgotten that the rest of the country isn't following our lead. &nbsp;The whole purpose of LEED is to provide a national, even international, standard for building design and construction that minimizes the impacts of our work on the environment. &nbsp;Having spent a lot of time memorizing what the requirements are, I can attest that the principles at play in LEED are actually good ones -- a lot of emphasis is placed on choosing appropriate sites and other factors that have a much bigger impact on a building's energy use than what kind of air handling equipment it has.<br /><br />I can't say that I learned anything useful from the LEED AP exam. &nbsp;I also can't say that it was easy, or that studying for it was entertaining, or that now I feel more empowered to work for green buildings, or that I am now more capable of persuading clients on why to build better buildings. &nbsp;I will probably forget everything that I memorized in short order, because I won't be using the information regularly, and because the numbers change every few months when new LEED Addenda get released. &nbsp;But I have made a public commitment of my time, energy, and money toward fighting climate change, and I will keep it up until being a LEED AP is no longer a signifier of something unique, and something better comes along to signify my commitment.<br /><br /><br /></div>
