Hello friends,

It's been almost a year since I last posted here, but in anticipation of my upcoming mission trip to Santa Fe, New Mexico, I have decided to give the blog a makeover.  Since my time in Rome is finished, I thought a new title was appropriate: "Not Built in a Day" reflects the original Roman origins of the blog but also makes room for more general reflections on architecture and urbanism.  From now on you can expect more posts from me about my general travels & work (travaux).  I hope you enjoy!

So, Santa Fe!  Thanks to the incredible support & generosity of my family and the Lilly Scholars program at Duke, I will be leaving on Friday the 5th for a mission trip with the Presbyterian Campus Ministries of Duke and ECU.  We'll be hosted by First Presbyterian Church of Santa Fe, where we will study and engage in issues of food policy, environmentalism, and interfaith dialogue.  We are planning to work with local homeless shelters and a community farm, visit museums, and take time to reflect at Ghost Ranch and the Christ in the Desert Monastery.

Although I probably won't be able to update the blog during my trip, I'll take notes and pictures during the trip so I can post when I return.  If you are interested in receiving e-mail updates as well, please let me know!

This should be an exciting & rewarding trip, and I am grateful to all of my family and to the Duke Chapel PathWays program for making this experience possible for me.  Thank you!
