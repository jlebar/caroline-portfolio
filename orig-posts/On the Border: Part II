<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">It's been over a year since my last post about my trip to the US-Mexico border, but I'm finally getting around to posting the rest of my thoughts and photos. &nbsp;If you want to remind yourself why this is an important topic (aside from the election-year immigration hype), check out the following short documentary. &nbsp;Thousands of unaccompanied minors are still trying to cross into the US from Honduras and Central America.<br /><br /><a href="http://p.nytimes.com/email/re?location=InCMR7g4BCKC2wiZPkcVUm6Wh5M56xwv&amp;user_id=a748e4fd8f37f868a50031e15284a5ca&amp;email_type=eta&amp;task_id=1444178345991856&amp;regi_id=0">Between Borders: American Migrant Crisis</a> (New York Times)<br /><br /><u>July 14th - Douglas, AZ</u><br /><br />Our second day at BorderLinks had us up early and on the road to Douglas, Arizona, a border town that neighbors the larger town of Agua Prieta in Mexico. &nbsp;During the two-hour drive, we stopped at Tombstone, AZ, a laughable tourist trap where there was once a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunfight_at_the_O.K._Corral">pointless gunfight</a> that for some reason has become famous. &nbsp;We wandered around for a bit, marveling at the racist stereotypes on display in the shop windows, before finishing our trip to Douglas.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Border Patrol is stationed along its length every few hundred yards - at least near the town - in their white and green trucks, watching it. &nbsp;Our little group grew exhausted from the heat after being outside only a few minutes in the brutal July sun. &nbsp;We would learn later about the many casualties, often youths, who have been shot while climbing the wall, including American citizens. &nbsp;The Border Patrol often cannot tell the difference between American and Mexican citizens, and the shoot-first-ask-questions-later mentality that seems to be shaking the nation this year appears to be quite common at the border.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

someone else always shows up. &nbsp;That week, it was our group and a few others. &nbsp;We walked down the main road leading to the border crossing and laid crosses on the sidewalk in memory of those who have died in the desert trying to reach safety in the US. &nbsp;We laid over 200 crosses, but there have actually been many more deaths than that. &nbsp;While we walked, it started to rain, and the smell of rain and cars was very strong. &nbsp;It was the first time I had seen rain for some time, and I still remember feeling grateful for it.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;
