My final pie of the California pie series was not very photogenic, although it tasted great considering I had to stoop to using canned cherries (why aren't there any sour cherries in California grocery stores?!?).  It was a basic cherry pie with store-bought crust, made quickly for a summer barbeque.  Here's a close-up:<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_BPRHjFkCSTM/TIcHTQqjjEI/AAAAAAAAHkU/Efz366D6DJI/s1600/IMG_5513.JPG"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_BPRHjFkCSTM/TIcHTQqjjEI/AAAAAAAAHkU/Efz366D6DJI/s320/IMG_5513.JPG" /></a><br /><br />And that concludes my summer baking spree!  We shall now return to the subject this blog is really about, which is architecture/design/stuff I like.  This week I begin my master of architecture program at Columbia's GSAPP.  But since I don't have any work to show yet - I haven't actually had any classes yet - here are some "progess shots" of my brand-new apartment!<br /><br />Some of you have doubtless heard about my apartment-hunting difficulties...  After several months of fruitlessly searching for roommates, I finally found (and rented) a sublet room, only to visit it upon my arrival in the city and find that it was not at all what I expected.  Within 24 hours I managed to find a new place, a 4th floor studio apartment (it's much easier when you're actually here!), and here it is:<br /><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BPRHjFkCSTM/TIcHUULKojI/AAAAAAAAHkc/eZ44YhoUnJc/s1600/IMG_5518.JPG"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BPRHjFkCSTM/TIcHUULKojI/AAAAAAAAHkc/eZ44YhoUnJc/s320/IMG_5518.JPG" /></a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BPRHjFkCSTM/TIcHVRJu1AI/AAAAAAAAHkk/rkFF2p8ymC4/s1600/IMG_5519.JPG"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BPRHjFkCSTM/TIcHVRJu1AI/AAAAAAAAHkk/rkFF2p8ymC4/s320/IMG_5519.JPG" /></a> <br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BPRHjFkCSTM/TIcHWQrGKCI/AAAAAAAAHks/raLozN-qEmI/s1600/IMG_5521.JPG"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BPRHjFkCSTM/TIcHWQrGKCI/AAAAAAAAHks/raLozN-qEmI/s320/IMG_5521.JPG" /></a><br /><br />Since I took these photos I have put up posters, and eventually I'll replace the bedspread, put a cover on the futon, change the curtains, etc.  For more pictures, see my Picasa web album here: <a href= "http://picasaweb.google.com/caroline.schermer/ApartmentPhotos#">Picasa</a>.<br /><br />My building is an old early 1900s rowhouse, completely surrounded by Columbia-owned dormitories and just one block from campus.  The location couldn't be better!  The only downside is dealing with 100-year-old floors, creaky stairs (no elevator), and a tiny kitchen.  But I'll survive!<br /><br />Thanks to everyone for their thoughts & well-wishes for my move...  everything went well and I'm excited for classes to begin!
