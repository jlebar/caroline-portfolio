the train itself would have an exercise car with stationary bikes, elliptical machines, and other equipment that could be used en-route. &nbsp;To encourage commuters to meet up and form athletic teams, we proposed a smartphone application that would show what facilities are available, who's using what fields and when, and which groups need more players or are looking to start teams. &nbsp;At the terminal station, Ponte Tresa, we proposed an outdoor gym on the station roof, including a glass-bottomed pool that would allow swimmers to watch the trains coming and going from the station. &nbsp;The app could also help users plan their fitness routines, using the very reliable train system (a train every 15 minutes) as a way of structuring a workout.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

we had lectures from a number of local architects who were also working on projects for the area, but not from the municipality. &nbsp;This part of Switzerland is very beautiful and Morcote basically a resort town, but growth of the nearby city of Lugano, and the strength of the Swiss franc versus the euro in Italy, means that more and more Italian commuters are projected to come through this area to work in Switzerland. &nbsp;Still, we enjoyed developing our somewhat fantastical proposal and thinking about rooftop pools and train station climbing walls. &nbsp;You can see the results of our design work on my <a href="http://notbuiltinaday.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr page</a>.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;
