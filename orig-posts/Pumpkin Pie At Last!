A mere 4 months after the pumpkin roasting/pureeing/freezing of the previous post, I present to you, (only slightly burnt and disfigured) pumpkin pie!  The burning and disfiguring is entirely my own fault - I stupidly placed the pie on a cookie sheet before putting it in the oven, instead of putting the cookie sheet on the rack below, which caused the cookie sheet to warp as it heated, which twisted the pie, causing it to spill... etc.  Duly noted not to do that again.

My pureeing could also use some work, it turns out.  The pie turned out very pumpkin-y, as expected from using fresh/frozen pumpkin, but slightly chewy because of the pumpkin pieces still in it.  Oh well - a real blender is on its way to help with this problem!  Special thanks to Dad for his modified recipe.

Meanwhile, it's spring break, hence the flurry of posts.  And it's actually starting to feel like spring around here; the high today was 68, and my tree is in bloom!  Let's hope it keeps it up!  Last week Mom was visiting, so we went to see "The King's Speech" - very good - and "Billy Elliott," the musical.  I can't say as much for the musical, unfortunately; I thought the plot was bizarre, the songs not very memorable.  But it had some funny moments and was interesting.  We also went to see the premiere performance of Roger Zare's piece in the Impressionist Suite.  See: <a href="http://www.rogerzare.com/performances.htm">Roger's website</a>.  We loved hearing the work of my famous friend!

Also meanwhile, my to-do list looks like this:  1. Finish portfolio.  2. Get a job using said portfolio.  3.  Make approximately one thousand decisions related to the wedding.  Should be easy, right?  Let's hope so!  But seriously, the job hunt begins ASAP, and classes start back on Monday, so once again I will be extremely busy.  But that's generally the way I like it!  I'll try to get pictures up on Picasa soon with some of my work from this semester.
