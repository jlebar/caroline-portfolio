So you're driving down the street (or maybe even walking, it's a free country) when you suddenly spy a very ugly new building.  But you're not sure what makes it so ugly.  That's where I'm here to help!  For years now, Justin has been trying to get me to write down my thoughts about ugly contemporary buildings, at least as they appear here in Silicon Valley, but I've always hesitated.  Maybe I'm afraid of criticizing other architects, who may be local folks that I know; maybe I hesitate because I do want to encourage more housing to get built, and don't want to criticize something we manifestly need.  But enough is enough, and I'm tired of these buildings.  Thus - this post.

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">The buildings I wish to call out are what I have named "kitchen sink buildings."  Why kitchen sink?  Because the designer included everything except the kitchen sink when designing the building.  Signs of a kitchen sink building include:</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">1.  A proliferation of roofs, all of them with little "hats."  Each roof has its own overhang!  Each overhang may have its own size / shape!  No two roofs are not topped by little useless overhangs!  These overhangs are purely decorative - they provide no shade, release no water, conceal no mechanical equipment.  They are ornamental.</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">2.  A proliferation of masses.  A single building may be built to look like many smaller buildings (typically the size of townhouses) all in a row.  Each "sub-building" is in a different plane from its neighbor, either recessed in or projecting out.  The important thing is that the building - it's usually one large building - has many different planes, roof heights, balconies, pop-outs, pop-ins, what have you.  These broken-up masses are purely decorative.  They don't really indicate a main mass and subordinate masses, or differentiate parts of the building, or even indicate actual townhouses.  These are typically apartment buildings, not townhouses, so each "slice" is actually several apartments.  All this "playful massing" is just there to add visual interest and make the building "contextual," ie, look like a bunch of townhouses.  Apparently "context" means the same thing as "townhouses" these days, despite a lack of actual townhouses in this area.</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">3.  A proliferation of materials.  Why settle for one cladding (exterior finish) material when you can have three, or four?  Why pick one color when you can have five?  My very favorite example of this is a building down the street from my office.  It has metal panels, stucco, two types of marble, and at least five colors on its exterior.  Why couldn't the designer have settled for one type of stone - why two?  There is no answer, except that the designer failed to exercise restraint.  Use all the colors!

If you're familiar with this website, you can understand why so many houses look ugly.  For commercial buildings, similar rules apply.  Look for these telltale signs: roof lines; materials; massing (how the building is shaped overall).</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Questions to ask:</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">1.  Start at the top.  How many different roofs does this building have?  What shape is it / are they?  Does it appear to have an arbitrary number of roofs?  Does each roof correspond to a specific, identifiable space for the building (eg - one for the main part, one for the smaller, secondary part), or is it a big mishmash of roofs?  If every roof has a hat, and there are more than three separate roofs, you may be looking at a kitchen sink building.</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">2.  Next, look at the shape.  It this one building meant to look like several?  If you aren't sure, try walking around it.  If there is a repeating pattern of shapes, then it's probably just one building.  How many different planes does it have?  If more than three, it's probably a kitchen sink building.</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">3.  Last, look at the colors and materials.  Count how many different railing patterns, window sizes, paint colors, types of materials (brick, stone, stucco, metal, etc) it has.  An "ordinary" building probably only has two, at the most, of each of these - maybe two types of windows, two colors, two materials.  More than that is a good sign that the designer has no restraint, or no taste.</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">And that's it!  You're now an expert at identifying the types of contemporary buildings that I find most irritating.  There's a good chance that if the building in question meets these criteria, it was built in the last 10 to 15 years and rents for $3500/month for a one-bedroom apartment, with access to an exercise room and roof deck.  Now, sometimes these are hotels instead of apartments, or perhaps an office building, but your odds are good that they're offering some kind of move-in incentive and would like you to sign up right now.</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

</div><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">You may be asking yourself, "How well will these buildings age?  What's next for them?"  Well, astute reader, you have asked a very good question.  How are property managers going to keep all these colors looking sharp?  Will they eventually run out of "Fire Truck Red" and "Eyesore Orange" and have to choose a different shade?  Will the building even make sense once it's been repainted in fewer colors?  Or will people just tear them down, or come to love them and actually keep them maintained?  Only time will tell!
