<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I've read a lot of pieces about the removal of Confederate monuments from public spaces in the South over the last couple months, and I know this is a difficult topic still for many people. &nbsp;But I haven't yet seen anyone fully articulate my own thoughts about this, so here's one more foray into the discussion.<br /><br />The public square is where, I would argue, we put our values on display.&nbsp; Historically, this has taken the form of church facades, city hall facades, bank facades, monuments, art pieces, flags,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp; Today we are probably more likely to install an art piece than a monument to a great man (or, less commonly, woman).&nbsp; We install pieces that speak to our unity, or commemorate tragic losses, or inspire us.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/arts/design/confederate-monuments-cyclorama-atlanta.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/arts/design/confederate-monuments-cyclorama-atlanta.html</a><br /><br /><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/arts/design/theodore-roosevelt-statue-natural-history-museum.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/arts/design/theodore-roosevelt-statue-natural-history-museum.html</a><br /><br />Columbus at Columbus Circle - building the house around it</div>
