<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">We're from the mid- to tail-end of the 1980s, and what are we doing now? &nbsp;<i>Living the dream</i>, that's what. &nbsp;Maybe it's not quite the dream our parents had for us, but it's a dream nonetheless. &nbsp;Sometimes I like to sit back and think about what my friends are doing and give a tiny mental fist-pump for everyone. &nbsp;Maybe because I never really had a clear idea of what I was going to be "when I grew up," I'm still not quite over the idea that so many of us have "made it" - to jobs or positions or universities where we get to do/study/research/practice what interests us. &nbsp;And most of what I see written about our generation (apparently we're the "millenials") is that we're all wasting our precious youth, or having it wasted for us by the recession economy: we're working in dead-end jobs with only a fond wish for promotion, sleeping on a lot of sofas, drinking ourselves to death, and looking for love in all the wrong places. &nbsp;So for once, I'd like to celebrate those of us who are making it. &nbsp;We're doing ok, you guys, and I think we're going to be ok.<br /><br />Shout-outs to:<br /><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Half a dozen teachers, teaching in Oakland and Fairfield and Tallahassee and beyond</li><li>A good crop of medical students &amp; MD/PhDs, getting ready to go out and save some lives in New York, New Orleans, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and beyond</li><li>Several stunning scientists researching chemistry and biology and even <a href="http://www.southernfriedscience.com/?cat=446">sharks</a></li><li>Some resourceful religious types helping the rest of us figure it all out</li><li>So many amazing "intern architects" trying to save the world through design (and black clothing)</li><li>All those prodigious programmers who keep our computers from taking over the world</li><li>A watchsmith by day, and <a href="http://www.vicdumbaugh.com/">artist</a> by evening</li><li>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Zare">composer</a>. &nbsp;For real.</li><li>An opera singer who moonlights (daylights?) as a tutor</li><li>A soon-to-be-veterinarian, reminding us that the world is more than just humans</li><li>Several social workers, non-profit/NGO gurus, and social-workers-in-training who make the world better for the humans most in need</li><li>Some lawyers making a difference in international politics, or at least making money!</li><li>All kinds of engineers (transportation, mechanical, electrical...) making cool stuff and making sure we get where we're trying to go</li></ul><div>I know I've forgotten to include some awesome jobs here (policewomen, cartoonists, film &amp; theater folks, arts administrators, <a href="http://astroquizzical.tumblr.com/">astrophysicists</a>), but you get the idea. &nbsp;Artists, teachers, sciencey-types, humanities-types - they're all there. &nbsp;I'm so proud of all of you.</div><div><br /></div><div>Good work, team '80s. &nbsp;Keep it up. &nbsp;(And if you want to share your blog/vlog/podcast/whatever, send me a message!)</div><div>&lt;3</div></div>
