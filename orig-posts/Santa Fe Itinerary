Here is the itinerary (below) for our trip, so you can get a sense of what we'll be up to!  The group is composed of four Duke students, four ECU (Eastern Carolina) students, and two campus ministers.  During the trip we'll split into "teams" that will rotate between working at the homeless shelter and working on the local farm.

As I mentioned before, during the trip we'll stay at First Presbyterian Church, Santa Fe.  You can check out their website here: [www.fpcsantafe.org](http://www.fpcsantafe.org/).

Look for pictures, stories, and maybe even video to be posted here after the trip!
