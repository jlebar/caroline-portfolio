<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">http://www.architecture.com/RIBA/Contactus/NewsAndPress/PressReleases/2014/RIBACouncilmotioncallsonUIAtosuspendIsraeliAssociationofUnitedArchitects.aspx<br /><br />http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/rebelarchitecture/<br /><br />http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2014/06/140624-The-RIBAs-New-Tack160-6527965279.asp?WT.mc_id=rss_archrecord<br /><br />Is there an architecture of evil? &nbsp;I know what you're thinking - prisons, dungeons, the Death Star. &nbsp;But what I'm thinking about is this:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-phWzrUmF8ZU/T7vgWaVZyYI/AAAAAAAAAr4/LmrUVf4_FTc/s1600/IMG_5642.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-phWzrUmF8ZU/T7vgWaVZyYI/AAAAAAAAAr4/LmrUVf4_FTc/s1600/IMG_5642.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />This is a settlement in the Palestinian Occupied Territories, outside of Bethlehem. &nbsp;I took this photo in 2012. &nbsp;I want to be clear that I don't think the people living there are evil (not more than we all are, anyway, as we are all complicit in <a href="http://neweconomy.net/publications/lectures/kimbrell/andrew/cold-evil">cold evil</a> to some degree or another). &nbsp;And I'm not sure that I believe that building new housing, even in the middle of a desert on an unspoiled hillside, is inherently evil. &nbsp;But I think that building this particular housing project, on this particular hillside, was evil. &nbsp;And what makes this architecture evil, or complicit in evil, is its political significance. &nbsp;I think that to the extent that architecture can be involved in politics, and can represent power, architecture can be good or evil. &nbsp;As an (almost) architect, I want to believe that architecture is meaningful, powerful, and important. &nbsp;If so, then I must also accept that architecture can be oppressive, liberatory, or some of both, but I cannot accept that it is neutral.<br /><br />With 2014's bombing and invasion of Gaza, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was heavy on my heart and mind then, as I know it was for many. &nbsp;Lately I have also been struck by the conflict ongoing within the architectural profession about the architect's political role: Do we have a responsibility to resist unethical building, not just unethical construction practices that abuse workers, for example, but unethical building projects? &nbsp;Are there such things as unethical building projects? &nbsp;Should we turn down any work that we think violates human rights?<br /><br />A big controversy this year was when the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) called for a boycott of the Israeli Association of United Architects (IAUA) over violation of the<br /><br />Let's go back to the prisons / dungeons / Death Star idea. &nbsp;What if we can agree that many of the people imprisoned in the US should not be there? &nbsp;What if we think that the US judicial system imprisons far too many people, and especially people of color? &nbsp;Does that make building new prisons, to house more people, a form of cold evil? &nbsp;Building new prisons may alleviate the suffering of the people already in them, by giving them better living conditions, but it also perpetuates the system, and makes space for new victims.</div>
