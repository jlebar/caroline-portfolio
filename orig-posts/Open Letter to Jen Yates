<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Dear Jen,

I've been reading Cake Wrecks for over three years and EPBOT since you started it, checking my Google Reader feed every day in anticipation and even forcing my husband to look at your posts from time to time.  So I thought it was about time that I wrote you a thank-you note for all the humor and joy you've brought me.  I like to think that if I still lived in Florida, and was living in Orlando instead of Sarasota where I grew up, we could be friends; we have many shared interests (which explains my continued interest in your writing, and especially in EPBOT, which I prefer by far), we both enjoy cake and craft projects, and we both subject our husbands to undue amounts of stress (hi, Justin!).

What you do, however, that I only wish I could, is make it your mission to share your interests and sense of humor with the world in a way that's always affirming, supportive, and makes the rest of us readers feel like we're part of a network of awesome people - like we're not so alone.  You've introduced me to "Doctor Who" and "The Guild" and other shows/stories/music that have entertained me, and inspired me to share my own thoughts in this very blog.  I haven't bought either of your books (although I'm sure they're hilarious like everything you write), but I still feel welcome reading your posts every day.  I've cheered at your support of geek girls and the trials they face, worried about your family's health, and wished I had more room in my small NYC apartment so I could try my hand at your craft tutorials.  And I've wondered over and over again how you manage to produce really funny prose practically every day.

In short, you're such a celebrity in my life that I can refer to "Jen" and my husband knows I'm taking about you and not any of the other Jens I know (often I refer to you as "the Cake Wrecks lady" to avoid confusion, but usually "Jen" is sufficient).  So thank you for sharing your wit, grammar knowledge, and wisdom with the many, many readers who follow your blog.  We truly appreciate it.

Best wishes/May the Force be with you, 

Caroline

PS:  I hope this letter doesn't seem creepy, but based on the number of creepy things I've seen on Cake Wrecks, I suspect this has to rank very low on the creepiness scale.  Either that or Cake Wrecks has severely deformed my creepiness scale, in which case, I abjure responsibility!

PPS:  How nice are you to renovate your parents' entire house??  Of course this is only the latest example of how nice you are.  You rock.

PPPS:  Sorry this isn't in sonnet form.  Many things I may be, but a poet I am not.</div>
