For a party this week I tried - emphasis on tried - to make coconut macaroons.  However, we inadverently bought finely grated, untoasted, unsweetened coconut, not the larger shredded sweetened coconut called for in the recipe.  So I toasted the coconut myself and added extra sugar, but the end result favored the meringue, meant to hold the cookie together, over the coconut, which nearly disappeared.  The cookies were still quite tasty, and I have decided simply to pass this off as an invention: the coconut macaringue.  Enjoy!
