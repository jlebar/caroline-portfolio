<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><u>July 15th - Agua Prieta, Mexico</u><br /><br />After an uncomfortable night on the floor, we crossed into Mexico to visit several organizations working with migrants on the Mexican side of the border. &nbsp;The trip across the border into Mexico took no time at all. &nbsp;Immediately on the other side, we stopped at the Migrant Resource Center (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Centro-de-Recursos-para-Migrantes-279004262136307/">Centro de Recursos para Migrantes</a>), which assists people who have been repatriated by Border Patrols; warns against trying to cross the desert and the hazards there; and helps people return to their homes elsewhere in Mexico. &nbsp;The workers at the Center told us that lately there have been fewer people trying to cross due to the relatively weak economy, but even while we were there, a woman came in to get help. &nbsp;The Center documents abuses by Border Patrol during deportation proceedings (lack of medical attention, taking of identification or belongings, violence, etc) and liaises with other organizations to provide comprehensive services for migrants. &nbsp;The tiny center is doing what it can to stand up to a big problem, since many times, people who are deported back to Mexico are not from anywhere nearby, and have no idea how to return home or where to go after deportation.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

they had a variety of clothing and decorative items from the sewing efforts. &nbsp;While we were there, a painter was creating a mural above the front door -- every aspect of the co-op is created and cared for by the group.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

it must be incredibly difficult to live along that road, with the ever-present possibility of gunfire when the Border Patrol pursues a suspect. &nbsp;It's hard for me to imagine living in a place where a teenager could be shot on your doorstop at any time.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;
