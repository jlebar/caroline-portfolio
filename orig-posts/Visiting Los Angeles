<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Back in February, over President's Day weekend, we visited my sister in LA and spent a couple days seeing the city. &nbsp;This was my first visit, and only my second trip to southern California. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/ms?msid=215786767362233253749.0004f21ad39eeca4b3f7e&amp;msa=0">Here's a map</a> of the places we visited (or wanted to visit). &nbsp;We drove down along the 5 at night - a pretty boring drive - and stayed in an Airbnb in what I think was West Hollywood. &nbsp;On the first day of our visit we walked around Hollywood, seeing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grauman%27s_Chinese_Theatre">Grauman's Chinese Theater</a> (home of the <i>Star Wars</i> premiere in 1977, among many other movie premieres) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Records_Building">Capitol Records Building</a>. &nbsp;The area near the theater felt like a smaller, slightly more subdued version of Times Square.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Vine was covered with film reels and had film cameras on display.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HDs-0Gt_jJI/U8Il6MNK10I/AAAAAAAADqg/UH_Xonmwrwk/s1600/IMG_0059.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em;

it has a beautiful cast-iron atrium that's open to the public during business hours. &nbsp;And of course, it wouldn't be a legitimate trip to LA without visiting Gehry's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Concert_Hall">Walt Disney Concert Hall</a>. &nbsp;We walked all the way around it on the raised pathway that rings the building, with great views of the city and some interesting moments of interaction with the building. &nbsp;At certain points the exterior skin is "peeled away" to reveal views down into the lobby and side theaters. &nbsp;The titanium skin is somewhat loosely jointed at the sharp corners, and in other places reveals the structure holding it up. &nbsp;I've never seen a more over-engineered building, with so much structure required just to make a statement. &nbsp;But for a building that's supposed to grab your attention, it definitely works.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;
