<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I don't like biking to work.&nbsp; I don't like it much at all.&nbsp; I arrive at my destination grumpy and sweaty, having fought traffic and other cyclists, the cold, the wind, and my own fatigue the entire way.&nbsp; Now that it's nearly December, it gets dark early and my 6pm commute takes place after dark.&nbsp; And perhaps worst of all, I can't listen to music while I ride or do anything except concentrate on the task at hand, for fear of distraction leading to injury.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rMRfiaTRwM4/UpmNoUHp4TI/AAAAAAAAC3o/UzHLttpJNdU/s1600/IMG_20131102_124942.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rMRfiaTRwM4/UpmNoUHp4TI/AAAAAAAAC3o/UzHLttpJNdU/s320/IMG_20131102_124942.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />This part of California should be ideal for biking.&nbsp; I live in an area with strong aspirations to be a <a href="http://www.ci.mtnview.ca.us/city_hall/public_works/bicycling_in_mountain_view.asp">bike-friendly place</a>.&nbsp; The weather is rarely too hot or too cold for outdoor activities, and it hardly ever rains.&nbsp; There are plenty of bike lanes, and even a pedestrian- and bike-only bridge that allows me to get across a creek without having to take major roads.&nbsp; It's flat, unlike San Francisco.&nbsp; And lots of other people bike, so it generally feels safe on the roads.<br /><br />I like to make excuses: I don't have the right gear; I'm just getting used to it; I need practice to become comfortable.&nbsp; Well, now my bike is tricked out with head and tail lights, a bell, even a mirror, and I have a windbreaker, gloves, glasses, and reflective ankle straps.&nbsp; I have a rear rack with a pannier to hold all my stuff so I don't have to wear a bag while I bike.&nbsp; I have a high-visibility reflective jacket and lights on my wheels so I'm visible to cars from the side.&nbsp; My bike itself is new, and it's fast and quiet.&nbsp; I have nothing to complain about.<br /><br />And yet...&nbsp; I'm tempted to say I hate it.&nbsp; It feels barbaric, racing against cars to make the always-too-short traffic lights, clearly timed for motorized vehicles and not for bikes.&nbsp; I'm constantly afraid of hitting something (an open car door, other parts of a car, another cyclist, a pedestrian...) and of falling over, potentially injuring myself severely.&nbsp; I know people who have recently been hit by cars while biking.&nbsp; I hate it when my fellow cyclists fail to follow standard traffic rules - they pass on the right, and they don't use lights or bells or signals. &nbsp;They're often buff athletic guys in cycling outfits who can't wait to pass me.&nbsp; This isn't <a href="http://www.etravelblog.com/six-bike-friendly-cities-in-europe/">Amsterdam</a>, after all, or Japan, where you can see middle-aged folks in their work clothes biking around town.&nbsp; I feel awkward in my khakis and oxfords. &nbsp;It doesn't help that the usual work <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code#Work_place">dress code</a> in this area is a t-shirt and jeans - it's possible that the guys I see biking in the mornings don't have to change out of their cycling jerseys when they get to work. &nbsp;Compared to the convenience of taking the subway, or, in this area, of driving, it's becoming harder for me to argue that biking is really an equivalent form of transit. &nbsp;When it rains, biking becomes unsafe, and at that point I don't feel comfortable biking at all. &nbsp;In short, my bike is not a sufficient method of transportation; I can't rely on it as my sole means of getting to work.<br /><br />And yet again, I feel like I'm taking an ethical stand for something when I ride: for exercise, for directly experiencing one's neighborhood, for quieter streets, for less pollution, for less fossil fuel use*, for cycling as it <i>could </i>be.&nbsp; It could be fun, if more people did it, and if we had better bike lanes, fewer cars on the road as competition, and more vigilant drivers.&nbsp; What about dedicated bike streets, with better street lighting on those streets?&nbsp; This area doesn't (yet?) have the population density for real light rail, and Caltrain is too infrequent and accident-prone to make sense to use for the short distances I'm traveling.&nbsp; Biking is makes a lot of sense from a transit perspective.&nbsp; So I guess we'll see how long I last on moral fortitude alone - if only biking was more, well, fun! &nbsp;If you have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them in the comments.<br /><br /><i>For some tips on cycling safety, check out <a href="http://bicyclesafe.com/">this website</a>.</i><br /><br />*Since food production usually involves fossil fuel use, understanding the fossil fuel required for cycling means understanding where a cyclist gets her calories (which she uses to power the bike). &nbsp;An interesting discussion of this concept <a href="http://bicycleuniverse.info/transpo/energy.html">here</a>.</div>
