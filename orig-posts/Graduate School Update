This week I was overjoyed to learn that I have been accepted at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning & Preservation (GSAPP).  Although I am still awaiting several other decision letters, I can now celebrate the fact that I will be going to architecture school in the fall!  Huzzah!

Pictures & details from Santa Fe will be up sometime soon - in the meantime, you can check out my photos on my Picasa Web Album here:

UPDATED UPDATE:  I will be attending Columbia in the fall!
