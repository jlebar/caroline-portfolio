<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Did you grow up with a "haunted house" in your neighborhood? &nbsp;It turns out that some buildings that look like houses aren't really houses at all, but are instead the haunts of infrastructure. &nbsp;I first learned about these decoy houses from BLDGBLOG (Geoff Manaugh's excellent and thought-provoking blog) and found the idea too fascinating to pass over. &nbsp;Hidden among the ordinary houses in ordinary neighborhoods, buildings that look like houses to the casual observer are actually power substations, water pump stations, subway vents or exits, and more. &nbsp;Some have been built this way from scratch in order to appease neighbors. &nbsp;Others are ex-houses, converted from real houses into shells in order to conceal infrastructure or preserve the historic character of a neighborhood. &nbsp;All of them are a bit spooky. &nbsp;Here are few for your consideration.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto;

several more decoy houses are described in the comments. <br /><br />I love the idea of pieces of city infrastructure hiding in plain sight, disguised as ordinary buildings. &nbsp;I think it falls somewhere on the same spectrum with speakers disguised as rocks at Disney World, or trompe l'oeil paintings on the sides of blank ConEd buildings to look like townhouses or smaller-scale buildings, or parking garages made to look like apartment buildings, of which I have seen several in Silicon Valley. &nbsp;I have mixed feelings, however, about this last decoy architecture. &nbsp;For some reason, I think concealing necessary shared infrastructure, like electric substations, makes sense, while disguising apartment parking garages, which are large, private buildings, seems odd; perhaps it's because there are so many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1111_Lincoln_Road">well-designed garages</a> these days that it feels like a cop-out, or because it seems disingenuous to disguise one building as another. &nbsp;Hiding machinery or equipment inside a decoy structure is amusing, while hiding one building inside another seems like a failure of imagination. &nbsp;(Except, of course, in the case of theme parks, which I find fascinating.)<br /><br />Have you seen any decoy buildings? &nbsp;What were they hiding? &nbsp;Send me a picture if you can!</div>
