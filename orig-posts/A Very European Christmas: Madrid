<p dir="ltr">12/25/17<br>Merry Christmas from Madrid!</p><p dir="ltr">We had a long, agonizingly long, flight from California that was at least somewhat improved by the excellent good cheer of the flight staff, who all wore holiday hats and had decorated the aisle carts in garlands and lights.&#160; But I have been fighting a sinus infection, and neither of us got much (or any) sleep, so we still arrived in an acutely cranky mode.</p><p dir="ltr">After some minor confusion with the many (notably clean and quiet) public transit lines, we made it to the city center, which was, as expected, completely empty, with all the stores shuttered for the holiday.&#160; But a thought with respect to this: We're still trying to get used to the time change.&#160; The good news is&#160;that 1. Since it's Christmas Day and nothing is open, there's nothing to do, and nothing to miss out on, and 2. I just slept for 6 hours and it's now 5pm, which means the stores (such as they are today) are just now re-opening for the evening.&#160; And thus, I've decided that this is the best county to have jet lag in.<br><br></p>
