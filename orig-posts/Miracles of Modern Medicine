<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I can see, and it's a miracle (of modern medicine).<br /><br />I'd like to share my story in order to give well-deserved thanks to Dr. Daniel Pope and his team at the Bradenton Eye Depot in Bradenton, Florida.<br /><br />[Photoshop a before and after picture]<br /><br />It was 1993, I was five years old, and in a freak accident, I lost the lens in my left eye. &nbsp;I'll spare you the details, but the upshot is, never play darts without wearing eye protection. &nbsp;At the hospital, the eye surgeon (ophthalmologist) was able to remove the shattered lens and stitch up my eye. &nbsp;The accident had damaged my cornea, broken my lens, and scarred my retina, but fortunately, had not damaged the optic nerve. &nbsp;This meant I could still see and my eye could mostly recover. &nbsp;For the following months, I had to wear an eye patch, which as you can imagine looked great when I was the flower girl in my aunt's wedding that year. &nbsp;Sadly I was too young to appreciate the vast world of pirate-related humor available to me. &nbsp;I do hazily remember when I first tried to open my eye, that the world seemed excessively bright through the patch. &nbsp;Eventually, I stopped wearing the patch, the doctor took out the stitches in my eye, and things sort of went back to normal.<br /><br />As normal as things can be, that is, when you're a five-year-old who wears contacts. &nbsp;I started with glasses (prescription for the left lens only, clear glass in the right lens), but then the doctors realized I would do better with a contact lens. &nbsp;Soft lenses irritated me and I couldn't sleep with them in as required, so we went to a hard (gas permeable) lens. &nbsp;I couldn't put it in or take it out by myself, so you can imagine the agony when I would get dust in my eye and couldn't do much about it. &nbsp;My mom had to come to school to get the lens out, or one of the school nurses had to intervene. &nbsp;My teachers, naturally, tried to shield me from any potential dust-related activities, but it just made me feel isolated when I had to sit by myself during "dangerous" activities like using yarn.<br /><br />This lasted until second grade, when, finally, I figured out how to look in the mirror and stick the little plastic suction cup in my eye by myself to remove the lens. &nbsp;It took me a bit longer to figure out how to put it back in, but eventually I got that too.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years, when my biological nearsightedness caught up with me, and I was wearing contacts in both eyes. &nbsp;During a routine check-up, which I had every four to six months, the doctors discovered I had developed glaucoma (high pressure) in my injured eye. &nbsp;Thanks to their consistent care, the glaucoma was caught early, before any real loss of vision (glaucoma causes loss of &nbsp;peripheral vision first, then it slowly destroys the rest of the visual field), and I've been taking daily drops ever since. &nbsp;Glaucoma due to eye trauma is much less common than the typical age-related disease, but it's just as treatable, and thankfully has not required surgery (so far). &nbsp;I will continue going to the eye doctor every four to six months, likely for the rest of my life, to monitor the pressure in my eye.<br /><br />Fast forward again, I'm in college, my eyes have stopped growing and changing shape, and suddenly I have a choice. &nbsp;I can keep going the way things are, wearing a thick contact in my left eye, business as usual. &nbsp;Or I can get surgery and implant a new lens in my left eye. &nbsp;Up to this point I've been "aphakic," meaning without a lens, but I could become "pseudophakic," with an artificial one. &nbsp;Although I'll never be able to focus my left eye like I can my right, since all those years of being aphakic means I no longer have muscles to control the lens, I could have a lens implanted that permanently gives me middle-distance vision. &nbsp;Together with a new (thinner) contact lens, my vision could be significantly improved. &nbsp;There are risks, of course, but I'm a good candidate, and this is a standard surgery (same as cataract surgery) that my doctor performs almost every day. &nbsp;I decide that we should go for it, as soon as I finish graduate school, so that I have plenty of time to heal without any deadlines to meet.<br /><br />It's 2013, and the nurses are joking that I'm the "pediatric" patient at the outpatient eye surgery center. &nbsp;They see older patients all day long for cataract surgery, and I'm getting essentially the same thing, minus the cataract; the job's been half done, since they took out my lens in 1993. &nbsp;Now we're just finishing the procedure by putting a new lens back. &nbsp;As I lie in bed after the surgery, once I can open my eye again, I can see the ceiling fan in some detail. &nbsp;It's crazy - with my nearsighted right eye, I couldn't see it in any detail, and I realize that my damaged left eye is now, in some sense, better than my right. &nbsp;Up close, there's no question that my right eye is better, but further away, without corrective lenses, my left eye is sharper. &nbsp;It's a weird feeling.<br /><br />Feel free to make jokes about an aspiring architect with vision problems. &nbsp;If Beethoven could write symphonies while deaf, surely I can still succeed in a visual field. &nbsp;In fact, I can think of myself as a cyborg, with my artificial lens. &nbsp;I carry a card in my wallet that describes the lens implant in case I'm in an accident or need to prove my cyborg status.<br /><br />I'm fairly certain that if I lived not that long ago, I would have lost an eye. &nbsp;There were so many things that could have gone wrong: I could have developed lazy eye, through lack of adequate correction, with my brain slowly giving up on my damaged eye; I could have lost my vision to unchecked glaucoma; I could simply have lost the whole eye through less skilled surgery, infection, or lack of proper care. &nbsp;Instead, my new doctor here in California, a glaucoma specialist, tells me that the surgery was "perfect" and everything looks great. &nbsp;I now feel normal, and I rarely have to think about my injury and what I can or can't do as a result of it. &nbsp;I did have to take the California road test because I indicated on my application that I have glaucoma, and because at the time, I did not yet have a new left contact lens and failed the eye test. &nbsp;(California tests each eye independently, unlike every other state I've ever lived in.) &nbsp;The road test examiner helpfully reminded me that I should be sure to get regular check-ups because glaucoma is a serious disease. &nbsp;Gee, thanks, I would never have known that without you. &nbsp;On retaking the eye test, with my new contact, I passed. &nbsp;(By that time I had already passed the road test and had a temporary license.) &nbsp;This all caused me much grief, but thanks to my great doctors, I was able to get a standard California license, something I would not have been able to get before 2013 - I would have had to get a two-year license only, and potentially re-take the road test every two years. &nbsp;Wouldn't that have been lovely.<br /><br />All this is to say that while I can't be an astronaut, fighter pilot, or marksman (though I can be this kind of Marksman), I can have a pretty normal life, and I am incredibly grateful to Dr. Pope and his team for taking care of me for over 20 years, resulting in the improved vision I have today. &nbsp;Thanks are also due to my parents, of coures, for taking me to untold numbers of eye doctor appointments, which, however brief and convenient, were never really fun. &nbsp;But they were totally necessary. &nbsp;And with the benefit of hindsight (and regular sight), I am grateful that I went to all those appointments.<br /><br />All twenty years of them.<br /><br />Thanks, Dr. Pope and Bradenton Eye Depot. &nbsp;To borrow a phrase, I once was pretty much blind in my left eye, and now I see. &nbsp;Let's keep it that way.</div>
