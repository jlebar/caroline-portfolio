<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Happy anniversary to the best friend, co-conspirator, and husband I could ask for.  Somehow it seems like it's been a lot longer than two years, and in some sense it has, but these two years have gone faster than I could have imagined.  If these have been any indication, then I have a lot to look forward to in the next two, and in all the years after that.  You're the best.

PS: Maybe this year I'll get around to printing some of our wedding photos?  Maybe.  No promises.
