Hello friends,

This summer I decided - among my many projects to fill time since I won't be working full time - to keep my blog updated.  Huzzah!  So from now on, it's probably safe to expect new posts on a more than bimonthly basis.

Duke graduation was two weekends ago; you can see my photos on my Picasa Web Album [here](http://picasaweb.google.com/caroline.schermer/SeniorWeekAndGraduation?feat=directlink).

If you are interested in my future plans, you should be happy to know that I will be working in the San Francisco Bay area again this summer.  I'll be assisting at AP+I Design in Mountain View.  In the fall I will attend Columbia to begin the hazardous process of acquiring my M Arch.

But what of the many projects, you may ask?  I plan to:

1.  Convert 8 years of t-shirts to quilt format (that's 50 t-shirts)

2.  Convert 4 years of photos to scrapbook format

3.  Augment 2 years of cooking experience by baking through my new "Killer Pies" cookbook and the Westminster Fellowship Cookbook

I will try to post photos of said projects as they develop.

Hurrah for the summer!
