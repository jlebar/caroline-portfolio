When the question is "cake or ...," I choose cake.

This week I made a pineapple upside-down cake, with a few modifications from necessity.  I used Alton Brown's recipe, which calls for cornmeal - a bit unusual but I think it added an interesting consistency.  I don't have a cast-iron skillet, or even a cake pan, so I simply used a square 8x8 glass dish.  It worked just fine.  The cake came out chewy and sweet and pineapple-y, just what I wanted!  And overall, it was very easy to make.  I'd give it 5 stars.  And even Justin admitted that it was very good, despite having seen how much butter and sugar went into it!
