<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I'm still not sure how it happened, but last weekend I took my seventh (but not final) ARE, bringing me up to all seven exam attempts in the span of one year. &nbsp;The good news is that I passed, which means I have only one exam left to pass! &nbsp;In all, I'm pretty pleased with my progress; aside from failing Site Planning, things have gone relatively smoothly, although it's been a grueling and painful experience. &nbsp;I don't think there's a better way to do it, though, and I'm glad I pushed myself to get it done in a year, rather than drag it out over a longer period of time.<br /><br />Here's the original schedule I set myself, which would have had me complete everything last year:<br /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 13.1999998092651px; line-height: 14.7839994430542px;">March - PPP</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><span style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 13.1999998092651px; line-height: 14.7839994430542px;">April - SPD</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 13.1999998092651px; line-height: 14.7839994430542px;">June - Structural Systems (SS)</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 13.1999998092651px; line-height: 14.7839994430542px;">July - Schematic Design (SD)</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 13.1999998092651px; line-height: 14.7839994430542px;">September - Building Systems (BS)</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 13.1999998092651px; line-height: 14.7839994430542px;">October - Building Design &amp; Construction Systems (BDCS)</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 13.1999998092651px; line-height: 14.7839994430542px;">November - Construction Documents &amp; Services (CDS)</span><br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="background-color: white; font-family: 'Droid Sans'; font-size: 13.1999998092651px; line-height: 14.7839994430542px;">And here's the schedule I actually followed:</span></div><div style="text-align: left;">March (2014) - PPP</div><div style="text-align: left;">April - SPD</div><div style="text-align: left;">June - SS</div><div style="text-align: left;">July - SD</div><div style="text-align: left;">September - BS</div><div style="text-align: left;">November - BDCS</div><div style="text-align: left;">February (2015) - CDS</div><div style="text-align: left;">March - SPD re-take scheduled</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">The delay was partly due to a lack of available test dates on weekends (after taking SPD and SS on weekdays, I vowed to take all the other ones on Saturdays to lower my stress levels), and mostly due to my decision to take a break over the holidays. &nbsp;I didn't study at all in November or December, and then started back up in January this year for the final two. &nbsp;This gave me a much needed mental break, and I'm glad I spaced it out. &nbsp;I also needed more time to study for BDCS than I initially thought - it was a pretty difficult one.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">I'm finally starting to think about what I want to do once the exams are over, and it's hard to decide! &nbsp;There are so many interesting projects I could tackle now that I have my weeknights back. &nbsp;I just hope that I can motivate myself to spend my time well, rather than languishing on Facebook as it's so easy to do. &nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">To my architecture friends who are still on the journey, I wish I had some humorous wisdom to dispense, now that I've taken all the tests, but I think the fun has been beaten out of me. &nbsp;Here's the best I can do to sum up my recommendations:</div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>All you have to do is pass. &nbsp;For each test, I aimed to get about 75% of the questions correct; as long as I was getting roughly 75% right on the practice tests, I figured that would be sufficient, and it was. &nbsp;Don't over-study so you can get every question right - there's no gold medal for acing it, and you won't even find out how you did beyond pass or fail.</li><li>Don't neglect the vignettes. &nbsp;Those "fatal errors" are for real, and I think that's what killed me on Site Planning.</li><li>Most of the content is actually relevant, so think of the exams as a crash course in applied architecture, rather than a waste of your time. &nbsp;I have experienced most of what I studied on real projects in the field, and if you think of it as a way to get exposed to many different parts of architectural practice, rather than just a hoop to jump through, you won't go crazy as fast when you're on your 50th week of studying. &nbsp;(This is in contrast to LEED and AIA continuing education, much of which really is a waste of time!)</li><li>Take breaks when you need them. &nbsp;Don't make yourself crazy.</li><li>Use the study materials that work for you, and don't waste time on the rest. &nbsp;For me, that meant I ignored all the flash cards, but took every practice test I could find. &nbsp;It was enough.</li><li>Remember that there are ADA questions on every exam!</li></ul><div>I'm not quite home free, but I can see the light at the end. &nbsp;I can't wait to find out what post-ARE life is like! &nbsp;In the meantime, I'm happy to answer any non-test-content-specific questions that you have; send me a note, and good luck!</div><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div></div>
