Austin Channing Brown, *I'm Still Here: Black Dignity in a World Made for Whiteness* (2018)

The book is a series of personal anecdotes and reflections on being a Black woman working in a predominately white environment.  She describes, in moving and powerful language, what it's like to live with white fear, white fragility, and racism all around her, at work, in the world, and in the church.

The final chapter was one of the most powerful for me.  She writes about "rest[ing] in the shadow of hope" (p.179), that hope continues to die, over and over, and she continues to see her hopes perish, but that somehow, she can survive in hope's shadow: "This is the shadow of hope.  Knowing that we may never see the realization of our dreams, and yet still showing up.  I do not believe that I or my children or my grandchildren will live in an America that has achieved racial equality.  [...] It is working in the dark, not knowing if anything I do will ever make a difference.  It is speaking anyway, writing anyway, loving anyway.  It is enduring disappointment and then getting back to work."

I am a white woman, and I cannot claim to fully understand the depth and breadth of the struggle that Brown has experienced and describes as the death of hope.  I can understand, though, when I read the news every day about how we continue to destroy the environment - both our natural and manmade worlds - and continue to make destructive collective choices, what she means about watching hope die, and having to get back to work anyway.
