Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Caroline! Congratulations! I also hope to take the exam this year and just like you, I will challenge myself to go through a self-study mode at the least possible cost. :) I heard that v4 is now the coverage so I hope I will be able to get &quot;fresher&quot; materials online. Thanks again! Happy for you! P.s. For your future readers who are also would-be LEED Green Associate examinees, please feel free to contact me through my blog. Maybe we can study together and share notes! :)
