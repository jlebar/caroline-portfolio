speaking to you're comment on the actual wastefulness of the "book": while i agree that the printing of a book would use considerably more resources, it can't be ignored that the reading and downloading of the book now requires an energy source. this makes boiling down the footprint of the new format much more complicated, and i think it can be argued that the final environmental impact would be on par with or worse than a printed book. all that aside, the choice to use plastic for the "decoy" (or the idea of a decoy book in general) was a careless mistake.
