In "Roman Holiday", Gregory Peck sticks his hand in the Bocca della Verita and pretends that it gets bitten off (a joke apparently based on a superstition that the mouth will bite off the hands of liars)-- an ironic moment, given that his character and Audrey Hepburn's are lying to each other. So now you know. And I, on the other hand, am excited that I got to see this object vicariously through you.
