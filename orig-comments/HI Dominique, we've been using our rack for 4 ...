HI Dominique, we've been using our rack for 4 years now with no problems!  It's up against a wall, but the backboard doesn't touch the wall.  The bikes seem to keep the whole thing upright.  Our bikes are hybrids, not mountain bikes, so it couldn't hurt to use heavier materials, but probably not necessary.  Hope it turns out well!
