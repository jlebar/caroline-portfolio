HI Dominique, we&#39;ve been using our rack for 4 years now with no problems!  It&#39;s up against a wall, but the backboard doesn&#39;t touch the wall.  The bikes seem to keep the whole thing upright.  Our bikes are hybrids, not mountain bikes, so it couldn&#39;t hurt to use heavier materials, but probably not necessary.  Hope it turns out well!
