speaking to you&#39;re comment on the actual wastefulness of the &quot;book&quot;: while i agree that the printing of a book would use considerably more resources, it can&#39;t be ignored that the reading and downloading of the book now requires an energy source. this makes boiling down the footprint of the new format much more complicated, and i think it can be argued that the final environmental impact would be on par with or worse than a printed book. all that aside, the choice to use plastic for the &quot;decoy&quot; (or the idea of a decoy book in general) was a careless mistake.
